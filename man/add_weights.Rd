\title{Add a column of stratified survey weights to a data frame.
For use in surveys where you took a sample population out of a larger
source population, with a simple-random or stratified survey design.}
\usage{
add_weights(x, p, ..., population = population,
  surv_weight = surv_weight, surv_weight_ID = surv_weight_ID)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame of survey data}

\item{p}{a data frame containing pouplation data for groups in \code{...}}

\item{...}{shared grouping columns across both \code{x} and \code{p}. These are used
to match the weights to the correct subset of the pouplation.}

\item{population}{the column in \code{p} that defines the pouplation numbers}

\item{surv_weight}{the name of the new column to store the weights. Defaults to
"surv_weight".}

\item{surv_weight_ID}{the name of the new ID column to be created. Defaults to
"surv_weight_ID"}
}
\description{
Creates weight based on dividing stratified population counts from the source
population by surveyed counts in the sample population.
