\alias{plot_age_pyramid}
\title{Plot a population pyramid (age-sex) from a dataframe.
This assumes that your variables are called "age_group" and "sex", respectively.}
\usage{
plot_age_pyramid(data, age_group = "age_group", split_by = "sex", vertical_lines = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame}

\item{age_group}{the name of a column in the data frame that defines the age
group categories. Defaults to "age_group"}

\item{split_by}{the name of a column in the data frame that defines the 
the bivariate column. Defaults to "sex"}
  
\item{vertical_lines}{If you would like to add dashed vertical lines to help
visual interpretation of numbers. Default is to not show (FALSE),
to turn on write TRUE.}
}
