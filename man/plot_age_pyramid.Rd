\title{Plot a population pyramid (age-sex) from a dataframe.}
\usage{
plot_age_pyramid(data, age_group = "age_group", split_by = "sex",
  stack_by = split_by, proportional = FALSE, na.rm = FALSE,
  vertical_lines = FALSE, horizontal_lines = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Your dataframe (e.g. linelist)}

\item{age_group}{the name of a column in the data frame that defines the age
group categories. Defaults to "age_group"}

\item{split_by}{the name of a column in the data frame that defines the
the bivariate column. Defaults to "sex"}

\item{stack_by}{the name of the column in the data frame to use for shading
the bars}

\item{proportional}{If \code{TRUE}, bars will represent proportions of cases out
of the entire population. Otherwise (\code{FALSE}, default), bars represent
case counts}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{TRUE}, this removes NA counts from the age groups. Defaults
to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{vertical_lines}{If you would like to add dashed vertical lines to help
visual interpretation of numbers. Default is to not show (\code{FALSE}),
to turn on write \code{TRUE}.}

\item{horizontal}{lines If \code{TRUE} (default), horizontal dashed lines will
appear behind the bars of the pyramid}
}
\description{
Plot a population pyramid (age-sex) from a dataframe.
}
\note{
if \code{split_by} and \code{stack_by} are not the same, The values of \code{spit_by}
will show up as labels at the top of the pyramid.
