\title{Produces counts with respective proportions from specified variables in a dataframe.}
\usage{
descriptive(df, counter, grouper = NA, multiplier = 100, digits = 1,
  proptotal = FALSE, coltotals = FALSE, rowtotals = FALSE,
  single_row = FALSE)

multi_descriptive(df, ..., multiplier = 100, digits = 1,
  proptotal = FALSE, coltotals = TRUE, .id = "symptom")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe (e.g. your linelist)}

\item{counter}{A name of the variable (in quotation marks) that you would
like to have as rows.}

\item{grouper}{A name of the variable (in quotation marks) that you would
like to have as columns.}

\item{multiplier}{What you would like to have your proportions as (default
is per 100).}

\item{digits}{The number of decimal places you would like in your
proportions (default is 1).}

\item{proptotal}{A TRUE/FALSE variable specifying whether you would
proportions to be of total cases.The default is FALSE and returns
proportions for each column.}

\item{coltotals}{Add column totals on the end}

\item{rowtotals}{Add row totals (only sums counts)}

\item{single_row}{if \code{TRUE} and \code{grouper = NA}, then the output is flattened
to a single row so that variables can be concatenated into a data frame.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{columns to pass to descriptive}

\item{.id}{the name of the column identifying the aggregates}
}
\description{
Option to add row and column totals
}
\details{
The \code{descriptive()} function returns a single table with counts and
proportions of a categorical variable (\code{counter}). Adding a grouper adds
more columns, stratifying "n" and "prop", the option \code{coltotals = TRUE}
adds one row and \code{rowtotals = TRUE} (useful if a grouper is present) adds
one column.

The \code{multi_descriptive()} function allows you to combine several counter
variables into a single table where each row represents a variable and the
columns represent counts and proportions of the values within those
variables. This function assumes that all of the variables have the same
values (e.g. Yes/No values) and atttempts no correction.
