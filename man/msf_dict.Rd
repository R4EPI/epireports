\title{MSF data dictionaries and dummy datasets
These function reads in MSF data dictionaries and produces randomised datasets
based on values defined in the dictionaries.
The randomised dataset produced should mimic an excel export from DHIS2.
A third function (switch_vals) is used to recode variables defined in the
dictionaries from coded to named form (e.g. 0/1 to No/Yes).}
\usage{
msf_dict(disease, name = "MSF-outbreak-dict.xlsx", tibble = TRUE,
  compact = TRUE)

gen_data(disease, varnames = "data_element_shortname", numcases = 300)

switch_vals(df, disease)
}
\arguments{
\item{disease}{Specify which disease you would like to use.
Currently supports "Cholera", "Measles" and "Meningitis".}

\item{tibble}{Return data dictionary as a tidyverse tibble (default is TRUE)}

\item{compact}{If TRUE, returns a neat data dictionary in single data frame. If FALSE, returns
a list with two data frames, one with variables and the other with content options.}

\item{varnames}{Specify name of column that contains varnames.
Currently default set to "Item".
(this can probably be deleted once dictionaries standardise)}

\item{numcases}{For fake data, specify the number of cases you want (default is 300)}

\item{df}{A dataframe (e.g. your linelist) which is passed to switch_vals function.}
}
