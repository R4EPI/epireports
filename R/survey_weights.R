#' Add a column of survey weights to a data frame.
#' For use in surveys where you took a sample population out of a larger
#' source population.
#'
#' NOTES TO OURSELVES:
#' We want to have two options for weighting:
#'
#' - Strata: What we already have in previous version.
#'           Just want to weight each person based on the source population.
#'           E.g. if we want to stratify our analysis based on age and sex in two
#'           different camps. Then we need the population breakdown by age and sex
#'           in those two camps. Then the function just creates a multiplier,
#'           by divding the number from the source population by the number in
#'           the sample population.
#'
#' - Cluster: This is more complex. Cluster sampling involves first choosing a
#'           number of clusters from a list of all clusters (e.g. pick a few villages
#'           out of all villages in an area),
#'           then within those villages choosing houses (theres several methods for this),
#'           and finally at the household level you either interview one person
#'           or everyone in that household.
#'           So the population no longer matters,
#'           instead of being population counts as in the above stratified example,
#'           you have a list of all clusters in the area with the number of houses
#'           within each cluster.
#'           Your survey dataset is collected with two levels, one for household
#'           and one for individual. But those two levels are merged, so for
#'           each individual there are two variables included: number of people in
#'           household, and number of people surveyed.
#'           To calculate the weight for each individual, you multiply the inverses
#'           (i.e. 1 over) the probability of: a cluster being chosen,
#'           a household being chosen in that cluster, an individual being chosen
#'           in their household.
#'
#'
#' @param x a data frame of survey data
#'
#' @param p a data frame containing popuplation data for groups in `...`
#'
#' @param cz a data frame containing a list of clusters and the number of
#'   households in each. Default is NULL as the default `method` is "stratified".
#'
#' @param ... shared grouping columns across both `x` and `p`. These are used
#'   to match the weights to the correct subset of the pouplation.
#'   Used only when `method` is "stratified".
#'
#' @param population the column in `p` that defines the pouplation numbers
#'
#' @param cluster_cz the column in `cz` that lists all possible clusters.
#'   Ignored if `method` is not "cluster" or if `ignore_cluster` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param household_cz the column in `cz` that lists the number of households per cluster.
#'   Ignored if `method` is not "cluster" or if `ignore_household` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param cluster_x the column in `x` that indicates which cluster rows belong to.
#'   Ignored if `method` is not "cluster" or if `ignore_cluster` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param household_x the column in `x` that indicates a unique household identifier.
#'   Ignored if `method` is not "cluster or if `ignore_household` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param individuals_eligible_x the column in `x` which specifies the number of people
#'   eligible for being interviewed in that household. (e.g. the total number of children)
#'
#' @param individuals_interviewed_x the column in `x` which specifies the number of people
#'   actually interviewed in that household.
#'
#' @param method what type of survey method you would like to use. Options are
#'   "stratified" (default) and "cluster".
#'   - Stratified: takes variables grouped population counts from `p` and divides
#'     the corresponding groups by counts of variables in `...` in `x`, to create a weight.
#'   - Cluster: Will multiply the inverse chances of a cluster being selected, a household
#'     being selected within a cluster, and an individual being selected within a household.
#' As follows:
#' (unique(cluster_cz) / unique(cluster_x)) *
#' (unique(household_cz) / unique(household_x)) *
#' (individuals_eligible_x / individuals_interviewed_x)
#' In the case where ignore_cluster and ignore_household are TRUE, this will simply be:
#' 1 * 1 * individuals_eligible_x / inidivudals_interviewed_x
#'
#' @param ignore_cluster If TRUE, set the weight for clusters to be 1. This
#'   assumes that your sample was taken in a way which is a close approximation
#'   of a simple random sample.  Ignores inputs from `cluster_cz` as well as
#'   `cluster_x`.  Default is TRUE, as the default `method` is "stratified".
#'
#' @param ignore_household If TRUE, set the weight for households to be 1. This
#'   assumes that your sample of households was takenin a way which is a close
#'   approximation of a simple random sample. Ignores inputs from `household_cz`
#'   and `household_x`.  Default is TRUE, as the default `method` is "stratified".
#'
#' @param surv_weight the name of the new column to store the weights. Defaults to
#'   "surv_weight".
#'
#' @param surv_weight_ID the name of the new ID column to be created. Defaults to
#'   "surv_weight_ID"
