#' Add a column of cluster survey weights to a data frame.
#'
#' For use in surveys where you took a sample population out of a larger
#' source population, with a cluster survey design.
#'
#' Will multiply the inverse chances of a cluster being selected, a household
#' being selected within a cluster, and an individual being selected within a
#' household.
#' 
#' As follows:
#'
#' ```
#' (unique(cluster_cz) / unique(cluster_x)) *
#' (unique(household_cz) / unique(household_x)) *
#' (individuals_eligible_x / individuals_interviewed_x)
#' ```
#'
#' In the case where ignore_cluster and ignore_household are TRUE, this will simply be:
#' 1 * 1 * individuals_eligible_x / inidivudals_interviewed_x
#'
#' @param x a data frame of survey data
#'
#' @param cz a data frame containing a list of clusters and the number of
#'   households in each. Default is NULL as the default `method` is "stratified".
#'
#' @param cluster_cz the column in `cz` that lists all possible clusters.
#'   Ignored if `ignore_cluster` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param household_cz the column in `cz` that lists the number of households per cluster.
#'   Ignored if `ignore_household` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param cluster_x the column in `x` that indicates which cluster rows belong to.
#'   Ignored if `ignore_cluster` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param household_x the column in `x` that indicates a unique household identifier.
#'   Ignored if `ignore_household` is TRUE.
#'
#' @param individuals_eligible_x the column in `x` which specifies the number of people
#'   eligible for being interviewed in that household. (e.g. the total number of children)
#'
#' @param individuals_interviewed_x the column in `x` which specifies the number of people
#'   actually interviewed in that household.
#'
#' @param ignore_cluster If TRUE, set the weight for clusters to be 1. This
#'   assumes that your sample was taken in a way which is a close approximation
#'   of a simple random sample.  Ignores inputs from `cluster_cz` as well as
#'   `cluster_x`.  Default is TRUE, as the default `method` is "stratified".
#'
#' @param ignore_household If TRUE, set the weight for households to be 1. This
#'   assumes that your sample of households was takenin a way which is a close
#'   approximation of a simple random sample. Ignores inputs from `household_cz`
#'   and `household_x`.  Default is TRUE, as the default `method` is "stratified".
#'
#' @param surv_weight the name of the new column to store the weights. Defaults to
#'   "surv_weight".
#'
#' @param surv_weight_ID the name of the new ID column to be created. Defaults to
#'   "surv_weight_ID"
