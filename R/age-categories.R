#' Create an age group variable
#' either give distinct breaks or specify vals for sequence
#' @param x Your age variable
#' @param breakers A string. Age category breaks you can define within c(). Alternatively use "lower",
#'  "upper" and "by" to set these breaks based on a sequence.
#' @param lower A number. The lowest age value you want to consider (default is 0)
#' @param upper A number. The highest age value you want to consider
#' @param by A number. The number of years you want between groups
#' @param separator A character that you want to have between ages in group names. The default is "-" producing e.g. 0-10.
#' @param ceiling A TRUE/FALSE variable. Specify whether you would like the highest value in your breakers, or alternatively
#' the upper value specified, to be the endpoint. This would produce the highest group of "70-80" rather than "80+".
#' The default is FALSE (to produce a group of 80+).
#' @param above.char Only considered when ceiling == FALSE.
#' A character that you want to have after your highest age group. The default is "+" producing e.g. 80+
#' @export
