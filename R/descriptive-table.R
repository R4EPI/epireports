#' Produces counts with respective proportions from specified variables in a dataframe.
#' Option to add row and column totals
#' @param df A dataframe (e.g. your linelist)
#' @param counter A name of the variable (in quotation marks) that you would like to have as rows.
#' @param grouper A name of the variable (in quotation marks) that you would like to have as columns.
#' @param multiplier What you would like to have your proportions as (default is per 100).
#' @param digits The number of decimal places you would like in your proportions (default is 1).
#' @param coltotals Add column totals on the end
#' @param rowtotals Add row totals (only sums counts)
