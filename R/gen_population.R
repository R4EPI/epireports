#' Generate population counts from estimated population age breakdowns.
#'
#' This generates based on predefined age groups and proportions,
#' however you could also define these yourself.
#'
#' @param total_pop The overal population count of interest - the default is
#'   1000 people
#' @param groups A character vector of groups - the default is set for age
#' groups: c("0-4","5-14","15-29","30-44","45+")
#' @param strata A character vector for stratifying groups -
#'   the default is set for gender: c("Male", "Female")
#' @param proportions A numeric vector specifying the proportions (as decimals)
#'   for each group - the default repeats c(0.079, 0.134, 0.139, 0.082, 0.067)
#'   for genders.  However you can change this manually, make sure to
#'   have the length equal to groups times strata (or half thereof).
#'   These defaults are based of MSF general emergency intervention standard
#'   values.
#' @param counts A numeric vector specifying the counts for each group.
#'   The default is NULL - as most often proportions above will be used.
#'   If is not NULL then total_pop and proportions will be ignored.
#'   Make sure the length of this vector is equal to groups time strata (or if it
#'   is half then it will repeat for each strata).
#'   For reference, the MSF general emergency intervention standard values
#'   are c(7945, 13391, 13861, 8138, 6665) based on above
#'   groups for a 100,000 person population.
#' @param tibble Return data as a tidyverse tibble (default is TRUE)
#' @importFrom dplyr bind_cols
#' @export
