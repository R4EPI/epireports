# Sample Size and Sampling methods

## Sample Size

```{r}
size <- sample_size(population_size = 10000,
                    precision = 0.005, 
                    design_effect = 1.5, 
                    expected_prevalence = 0.005)
size
```

```{r}
sample_size_households(size, 
                       avg_hh = 5, 
                       prop_under_5 = 0.15, 
                       frac_6_59 = 0.9, 
                       non_response_rate = 0.03)

```


## Sampling

### Random sampling

```{r}
# Insert some code to generate a random number sequence
```

### Cluster sampling

```{r}
# Insert some example code to do cluster sampling
```

# Study Findings

```{r}
linelist <- outbreaks::fluH7N9_china_2013 %>% 
  group_by(province) %>% 
  filter(n() > 5) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(!is.na(outcome))

design <- svydesign(ids = ~1,  #no cluster within strata
                    strata = ~province, # strata
                    weights = ~ 1, # sampling weights
                    data = linelist)

# get totals
svytotal(~outcome, design)

# compute something by another group. E.g. the mean
svyby(~outcome, ~gender, design, svymean)

# you can also compute confidence intervals
confint(svyby(~outcome, ~gender, design, svymean))
confint(svytotal(~outcome, design))
```


## Demographics

```{r}
linelist <- outbreaks::fluH7N9_china_2013 %>% 
  rename(sex = gender) %>% 
  mutate(age = as.integer(age)) %>%
  mutate(age_group = cut(age, breaks = seq(0, 90, 5), right = FALSE)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sex))

plot_age_pyramid(linelist)
```
