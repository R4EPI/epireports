This is a test document to gather functions and code snippets that eventually will evolve into an outbreak report template (+ package(s)).

```{r}
# read data from CSV
#linelist_raw <- readr::read_csv("linelist.csv")

# read data from Excel
# linelist_raw <- readxl::read_xlsx

linelist_raw <- outbreaks::fluH7N9_china_2013

### Data preparation

# Here document everything you do to clean the data.


# a good first step is to assign standard column names so that subsequent code
# uses stable column names. 
# in case the input data changes, you just need to fix the column mapping
# TODO: showcase and recommend the linelist package

# make a copy of your original dataset 
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw
# define clean variable names
cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))
# overwrite variable names with defined clean names
colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames

# alternatively you can manually rename columns
linelist_cleaned <- rename(linelist_cleaned, sex = gender)
```


```{r}
# THIS CAN BE DELETED WHEN WE USE A DIFFERENT DATASET 
# its just to be able to demonstrate posibilities

# generate artificial lab tests, symptoms and contact vars
lab_results <- linelist_cleaned %>% 
                select(case_id) %>% 
                mutate(test_result = sample(c("Positive", "Negative"),
                                            nrow(linelist_cleaned), 
                                            replace = T), 
                       symptoms = sample(c("Yes", "No"),
                                            nrow(linelist_cleaned), 
                                            replace = T),

                                          min = 10^3, max = 10^5))


```




```{r}

linelist_cleaned <- left_join(linelist_cleaned, lab_results,

### Person

* [Who is affected: how many in total; male or female; young, adult or old? What are the links between affected people â€“ work place, school, social gathering?  Is there a high rate of illness in contacts?  Is there a high rate of illness in health workers? You may want to include:  a bar chart showing case numbers or incidence by age group and sex; attack rates (AR); and numbers of deaths (in suspected and confirmed cases), mortality rates and/or case fatality ratio (CFR)]  



In total there were `r nrow(linelist_cleaned)` cases. There were `r linelist_cleaned %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>% count()` females affected and `r linelist_cleaned %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% count()` males. 

The most affected age group was `r descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group") %>% slice(which.max(n)) %>% select(age_group)` years. 


#### Age

Cases by sex

```{r}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "sex") %>%
  kable()
```

Cases by age group

```{r}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group") %>%
  kable()
```



Cases by age group and definition 
```{r}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group", "case_def", coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  kable()
```




Cases by age group and sex 
```{r}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group", "sex") %>% 
  kable()
```




Age pyramid
```{r}
plot_age_pyramid(filter(linelist_cleaned, !is.na(sex)))
```


CFR 

The case fatality ratio among those with known outcomes is below

```{r}
known_status <- linelist_cleaned[!is.na(linelist_cleaned$outcome), ]
deaths <- sum(linelist_cleaned$outcome == "Death", na.rm = TRUE)
population <- length(linelist_cleaned$outcome[!is.na(linelist_cleaned$outcome)])
```


```{r}
case_fatality_rate(deaths, population) %>% knitr::kable()
```


CFR by age group
```{r}
group_by(known_status, age_group) %>%
  do({
    deaths <- sum(.$outcome == "Death")
    population <- length(.$outcome)
    case_fatality_rate(deaths, population)
  }) %>%
  arrange(desc(lower)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

#### Attack rate

The attack rate among per 100,000 population is below - based on available population data for the whole country. 

```{r}
# define population 
population <- sum(population_data$population)

attack_rate(nrow(linelist_cleaned), population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The below gives the attack rate per week. 
```{r}
# cases for each week
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, epiweek)

# attack rate for each week
attack_rate(cases$n, population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
    
```
 
The below gives the cummulative attack rate per week. 
```{r}
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, epiweek) %>% 
  mutate(cummulative = cumsum(n))

attack_rate(cases$cummulative, population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```


#### Mortality


Mortality rate per 100,000:

```{r}
mortality_rate(deaths, population, multiplier = 10^4, digits = 1) %>%
  kable()
```


#### Univariate analyses (2-by-2 tables)

```{r, message = FALSE}
outcome <- linelist_cleaned$outcome == "Death"
is_male <- linelist_cleaned$sex == "Male"
is_child <- as.integer(linelist_cleaned$age) <= 12

univariate_analysis(measure = "OR", digits = 3, outcome = outcome, is_male, is_child) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


### Time

* [When did the cases fall ill? Are numbers increasing or stable? You may want to include an Epi curve (bar chart showing number of new (suspected and confirmed) cases each day/week) ]


There were `r sum(is.na(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset))` cases missing dates of onset. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
inc_week_7 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, interval = 7)
```

The peak of the outbreak was in `r data.frame(inc_week_7) %>% slice(which.max(counts)) %>% select(isoweeks)`. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
# plot your epicurve
plot(inc_week_7, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  theme_classic() + # give classic black/white graph 
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)", 
       captions = "Source: MoH of China data on dd/mm/yyy") + 
  # change visuals of dates and remove legend title
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  # change interval of date labels
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 week")
```

You may also want to stratify by gender. 


```{r, message = FALSE}
inc_week_7 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, 
                        interval = 7, 
                        groups = linelist_cleaned$sex)


plot(inc_week_7, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  theme_classic() + # give classic black/white graph 
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)", 
       captions = "Source: MoH of China data on dd/mm/yyy") + 
  # change visuals of dates and remove legend title
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        legend.title = element_blank()) + 
  # change interval of date labels
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 week")
```


### Place

*  [Across what area: one or several villages, all from same school, etc. You may want to include a map of the distribution of cases; attack rates by location]


#### Quick and simple map visualisation

The following is one example of how to use and display spatial data. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
# spatial packages 
# library(raster) # for downloading GADM shapefiles
library(tmap) # for plotting maps
library(tmaptools) # for tiles and spatial operations (kernel densities) 
library(sf) # for manipulating spatial objects easily
```




```{r, message=FALSE}

# reading in a shapefile 
# map <- read_sf(here("mapfolder", "china.shp"))


# download administrative boundaries 

## view ISO3 codes for countries 
# raster::getData("ISO3") 

## retrieve province boundaries from the Global Administrative 
## level = 1 specifies provinces 
## must be possible to do this as sf directly no? Is available on GADM.org
map <- raster::getData("GADM", country = "CN", level = 1)

## changing GADM to a sf object 
map <- st_as_sf(map)

```




```{r}
# subsetting shapefiles 

# Subset map to provinces of interest
mapsub <- map %>% filter(NAME_1 %in% unique(linelist_cleaned$province))

# change projection of subset 
mapsub <- set_projection(mapsub, current.projection = "longlat", projection = 4326, overwrite.current.projection = TRUE)

# simplify the shapefile (small islands in china sea)
mapsub <- simplify_shape(mapsub, fact = 1)
```




```{r}

# get random points in provinces occuring 
## CAN BE DELETED ONCE WE USE A BETTER DATASET
## stupid work around because st_sample hasnt implemented exact number points yet

## get points
a <- st_sample(mapsub, nrow(linelist_cleaned), type = "random") %>% 
  st_cast("POINT") %>% 
  st_coordinates() %>% 
  data.frame() %>%
  setNames(c("lon", "lat"))

## fix if too many or too few points
if (nrow(a) < nrow(linelist_cleaned)) {
  b <- matrix(rep.int(c(NA, NA), nrow(linelist_cleaned) - nrow(a)), ncol = 2)
  colnames(b) <- c("lon", "lat")
  a <- rbind(a, b)
}

if (nrow(a) > nrow(linelist_cleaned)) {
  a <- a[1:nrow(linelist_cleaned), ]
}

## merge to linelist
linelist_cleaned <- bind_cols(linelist_cleaned, a)

```





```{r, message=FALSE}
# downloading basemap tiles 

## view available basemaps at http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/
## Not all available - we need to find a better option 
osm_tiles <- tmaptools::read_osm(bb(mapsub, projection = "longlat"), ext = 1.05, type =  "osm")

## Alternative specify box
## If do not have a shapefile - choose based on coordinates (or name of place) 
# osm_tiles <- tmaptools::read_osm(bb(xlim = c(108.78, 122.94), ylim = c(20.22, 42.61)))

```



```{r}

# plot your basemap
basemap <- tm_shape(osm_tiles) + # osm tiles
  tm_raster() + #osm tiles as an image
  tm_shape(mapsub) + # shapefile
  tm_polygons(col = NA, alpha = 0) + # shapefile as polygon
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE) + # remove frame around plot
  tm_compass(position = c("right", "top")) + # add a north compass
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,250, 500), size = 1) # add a scalebar

# save basemap for later offline use  
# save(basemap, file = here::here("base.rda"))

# load basemap when need it offline
# load(file = here::here("base.rda"))
```


```{r}
# make linelist available for plotting 
## this could probably be done directly in linelist_cleaned
## unsure how other functions would react to an sf + dataframe obj though
cases <- st_as_sf(linelist_cleaned, coords = c("lon", "lat"))
cases <- set_projection(cases, current.projection = "longlat", projection = 4326)
```


```{r}
# dotmap 
basemap + 
  tm_shape(cases) + 
  tm_dots(col = "case_def",  
          palette = "Dark2", size = 0.5, 
          title = "Case definition") + 
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# choropleth 

## get counts by provinces 
counts <- count(linelist_cleaned, province) 

## merge population and get AR per 100000
counts <- left_join(counts, population_data, by = "province") %>% 
  mutate(AR = n/population * 100000)


## add counts to map data 
mapsub <- left_join(mapsub, counts, by = c("NAME_1" = "province"))

# plot choropleth
basemap + 
  tm_shape(mapsub) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "AR", 
              border.col = "black", 
              title = "AR per 100000 population") + 
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```



#### Mortality rate per district

```{r}

linelist_cleaned %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome)) %>%
  group_by(province) %>%
  do({
    province <- as.character(.$province[1])
    deaths <- sum(.$outcome == "Death")
    pop <- population_data[population_data$province == province, "population"]
    mortality_rate(deaths, pop, multiplier = 10^3)
  }) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, funs(round(., digits = 2))) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Province", "Number of cases", "Population",
                      "Incidence per 1000", "Lower 95% CI", "Upper 95% CI"))
```
