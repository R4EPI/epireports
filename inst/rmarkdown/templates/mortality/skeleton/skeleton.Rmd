# Introduction

# Methods

## Study Design 

## Sample Size and Sampling methods

### Sample Size

### Sampling

#### Random sampling

```{r}
# Insert some code to generate a random number sequence
```

#### Cluster sampling

```{r}
# Insert some example code to do cluster sampling
```

## Data collection

## Data analysis
<!-- TODO: add paragraph about R/sitrep -->

# Results


```{r}
# we first need to create a survery design that reflects the study
suvery_design <- svydesign(
  ids = ~1, # no cluster ids
  weights = NULL, # no sampling weights in this example
  data = study_data_cleaned
)
```

```{r}
# TODO: Arrivals and departures of included household members during the recall period;
```


## Demographic information

TODO: add some sample text with inline R

Age distribution of current household population by five year age groups, dependency age groups, and by child and adult populations, by gender.
