## this is either the begining of your recall period (which you define in advance)
## or a date after the start of recal if applicable (e.g. arrivals or births)

```{r survey_design}
## USE THIS TO SET THE STUDY DESIGN FOR YOUR SURVEY  ---------------------------
##
## This creates "survey objects" which can be used as data frames for calculating
## weighted proportions etc. 
## There are several options for study design here. 
## At the basic level you want to decide if it is a simple random or a cluster
## design study. You will then need to identify your weights variable. 
## You can also create several study designs, e.g. if you would like to have
## an overall design and a stratified design (e.g. by sex or by region). 
##
## Checklist for study design --------------------------------------------------
## 
## - [ ] Make sure you have created all necessary variables in earlier code chunks!!
## - [ ] Decide on your study design (cluster or simple random)
## - [ ] If doing cluster:
##          - [ ] place your cluster ID variable in the ids option 
##                (e.g. householdID - "fact_0_id" not availble in dat dict)
##          - [ ] specify your weight variable (created previously)
##                (set to NULL if want no weights)
## - [ ] If doing simple random: 
##          - [ ] set ids equals 1 to have no clustering 
##          - [ ] specify your weight variable (created previously)
##                (set to NULL if want no weights)
## - [ ] Create additional study designs based on strata 
##      (make sure that your weight variable is based on appropriately stratified
##        population data)


# simple random sample (using srvyr package)
survey_design <- study_data_cleaned %>% 
  as_survey_design(ids = 1, # 1 for no cluster ids 
                   weights = weight # weight variable created above 
                   )


# simple random sample stratified by sex

## Sample Size and Sampling methods

### Sample Size

### Sampling

#### Random sampling

```{r}
# Insert some code to generate a random number sequence
```

#### Cluster sampling

```{r}
# Insert some example code to do cluster sampling
```

## Data collection

## Data analysis
<!-- TODO: add paragraph about R/sitrep -->

# Results

```{r}
# TODO: Arrivals and departures of included household members during the recall period;
```


## Demographic information

```{r}
# add descriptive table with unweighted counts for different stuff
```

TODO: add some sample text with inline R

Age distribution of current household population by five year age groups, dependency age groups, and by child and adult populations, by gender.
```{r describe_by_age_group_and_sex}
descriptive(study_data_cleaned, 
            "age_group", 
            "sex",

         "%" = Female_prop, 
         "Male cases (n)" = Male_n, 
         "%" = Male_prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```


Age and gender distribution of household population covered by the survey.
```{r age_pyramid}
plot_age_pyramid(study_data_cleaned, 
                 age_group = "age_group", 
                 split_by = "sex",
                 proportion = TRUE) + 
  labs(y = "Proportion", x = "Age group (years)") +                    # change axis labels
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())   # remove title and move legend
```

Weighted age distribution.
```{r age_pyramid_survey}
# TODO: Table - Age distribution of the sample population and of the study population.
plot_age_pyramid(survey_design_sex,
                 age_group = "age_group",

                 proportion = TRUE) +
  labs(y = "Proportion", x = "Age group (years)") +                    # change axis labels
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())   # remove title and move legend
```


## Mortality

Reported causes of death and cause-specific mortality rates, weighted

```{r}

# you will get an extra column, for weighted counts, weighted % with CI, and mortality per 10,000 persons/day with CI
cause_of_death_prop <- survey_design %>% 
  group_by(cause_of_death) %>% 
  summarize(n = survey_total(vartype = "se", na.rm = TRUE),
            proportion = survey_mean(vartype = "ci", na.rm = TRUE),
            ) %>% 
  mutate(n = round(n)) %>% 
  select(-n_se)

cause_of_death_mort <- survey_design %>% 
  group_by(cause_of_death) %>% 
  summarize( mortality = survey_ratio(as.numeric(died) * 10000, obstime, vartype = "ci")) 

dplyr::left_join(cause_of_death_prop, cause_of_death_mort) %>% 
  unite_ci("% (95% CI)", starts_with("proportion"), m100 = TRUE, percent = FALSE, digits = 1) %>%
  unite_ci("Mortality per 10,000 persons/day (95% CI)", starts_with("mortality"), m100 = FALSE, percent = FALSE) %>%
  kable()


```

Reported causes of death and cause-specific mortality rates, by age, weighted
```{r}

survey_design %>% 
  tabulate_survey(cause_of_death, age_group) %>%
  kable()

```

Reported causes of death and cause-specific mortality rates, by gender, weighted
```{r}
