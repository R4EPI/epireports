# Introduction

# Methods

## Study Design 

## Sample Size and Sampling methods

### Sample Size

### Sampling

#### Random sampling

```{r}
# Insert some code to generate a random number sequence
```

#### Cluster sampling

```{r}
# Insert some example code to do cluster sampling
```

## Data collection

## Data analysis
<!-- TODO: add paragraph about R/sitrep -->

# Results


```{r}
# we first need to create a survery design that reflects the study
suvery_design <- svydesign(
  ids = ~1, # no cluster ids
  weights = NULL, # no sampling weights in this example
  data = study_data_cleaned
)
```

```{r}
# TODO: Arrivals and departures of included household members during the recall period;
```


## Demographic information

TODO: add some sample text with inline R

Age distribution of current household population by five year age groups, dependency age groups, and by child and adult populations, by gender.
```{r describe_by_age_group_and_sex}
descriptive(study_data_cleaned, 
            "age_group", 
            "sex", 
            rowtotals = TRUE, 
            coltotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Age" = age_group, 
         "Female cases (n)" = Female_n, 
         "%" = Female_prop, 
         "Male cases (n)" = Male_n, 
         "%" = Male_prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

```{r describe_by_age_group_and_sex_wider_age_groups}
study_data_cleaned <- study_data_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(age_group_wide = age_categories(age_in_years, 
                                         breakers = c(0, 1, 5, 15, 60)))

  #        "%" = Male_prop) %>%

  kable(digits = 2)
```

Age distribution of current household population by five year age groups and by gender.
```{r age_pyramid}
plot_age_pyramid(study_data_cleaned, 
                 age_group = "age_group",

  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())   # remove title and move legend
```

```{r}
# TODO: Table - Age distribution of the sample population and of the study population.
```

## Morbidity

```{r}
# symptoms start with sym_

cols <- colnames(study_data_cleaned)
symptom_columns <- cols[grepl(pattern = "^sym", x = cols)]

survey_ciprop_foreach_binary_variable(design = suvery_design, 
                                      variables = symptom_columns) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```



## Mortality

Reported causes of death and cause-specific mortality rates;
```{r}
descriptive(study_data_cleaned %>% 
              filter(!is.na(cause_of_death)), 
            "cause_of_death") %>%

linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>%  # remove rows with missing outcome
  summarise(deaths = sum(DIED),    # tally deaths
            population = n()) %>%  # count population
  # calculate case fatality rate
  do(case_fatality_rate(.$deaths, .$population, mergeCI = TRUE)) %>% 
  rename("Deaths" = deaths,
         "Population" = population,
         "CFR (%)" = cfr,
         "95% CI" = ci) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2) 

```


```{r}
suvery_ciprob(suvery_design, "cause_of_death") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
suvery_ciprob_stratified(suvery_design, "died", "age_group") %>%
