# Introduction to this template

This is a template which can be used to create an automated outbreak situation
report for meningitis.

- It is organised by time, place and person. 
- You can type normal text in white spaces (such as here) and r-code in grey
    spaces (denoted by three backticks and r) (see [Rmarkdown
    introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) and
    [Markdown basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html))
- Introductions and contents of sections are within square brackets "[...]" and
    can be deleted as appropriate
- Examples of inline code (to automate updating numbers, e.g. in the "Person section"), can
    similarly be removed/updated
- Code itself can be deleted, but as a word of caution: make sure you aren't
    deleting bits where variables are created/manipulated, or at least update
    them appropriatley
- For a more detailed exaplanation of this template, see [Wiki](https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep/wiki)
- Feedback and suggestions are welcome at the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep/issues)


## Installing and loading required packages 

Several packages are required for different aspects of  analysis with *R*. 
You will need to install these before starting. 
We will be using the following packages. Some of these packages automatically
install other packages they need to work (called dependencies).

These packages can be quite large and may take a while to download in the
field. If you have access to a USB key with these packages, it makes sense to
copy and paste the packages into Program Files/R/R-[version]/library.


```{r setup, include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# hide all code chunks in the output, but show errors
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, error = TRUE, fig.width = 6*1.25, fig.height = 6)
# set default NA to - in output, define figure width/height
options(knitr.kable.NA = "-")

# Installing required packages for this template
required_packages <- c("knitr",       # create output docs
                       "dplyr",       # clean/shape data
                       "forcats",     # clean/shape data
                       "ggplot2",     # create plots and charts
                       "sitrep",      # MSF field epi functions
                       "incidence",   # create epicurves
                       "aweek",       # define epi weeks
                       "epitools",    # 2x2 tables and other epi goodness
                       "sf",          # encode spatial vector data
                       "ggspatial")   # plot maps

for (pkg in required_packages) {
  # install packages if not already present
  if (!pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
  
  # load packages to this current session 
  library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
}


# set default text size to 16 for plots
# give classic black/white axes for plots
ggplot2::theme_set(theme_classic(base_size = 18))

# Set the day that defines the beginning of your epiweek.
# you can start the week on any day of the week
# (the ISO standard is to start on Monday) 
aweek::set_week_start("Monday")
```




```{r read_DHIS_excel_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# If your linelist is an excel export of data from DHIS2 use this code chunk
# This assumes your data fits the standardised MSF data dictionary for this
# disease (Otherwise use one of the code chunks below for csv DHIS data and for
# non DHIS data). This script is adapted to fit to DHIS standardised data. 
# If you don't have lab tests or do not wish to create a case definition, 
# then you will need to fix code stratified by case definition later in the script


## Read data ------------------------------------------------------

# USE ONE OF THE BELOW TWO OPTIONS TO READ IN YOUR DATA FROM EXCEL
# one version is for password protected files

## Excel file ---------------------------
#
## To read in a specific sheet use "which"
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")

## Excel file (password-protected) ------
#
## Use the excel.link package 
# library(excel.link)
# linelist_raw <- xl.read.file("linelist.xlsx",
#                              xl.sheet = "Sheet1",
#                              password = askpass::askpass(prompt = "please enter file password"))

## DELETE THIS LINE --- YOU READ IN YOUR OWN DATA ABOVE!
linelist_raw <- gen_data("Meningitis") # generates a fake dataset for use as an example in this template

## MSF Meningitis Dictionary ---------------
## The data dictionary has variable names in the data_element_shortname column. 
## Possible values for each variable are specified in the Code and Name columns.
## Where code has the shortened values and name has the full text values. 

## get MSF data dictionary for meningitis 
linelist_dict <- msf_dict("Meningitis", compact = FALSE) %>%
  select(option_code, option_name, everything())

## you can look at the standard dictionary by uncommenting the line below
# View(linelist_dict) 

## you can view variable names in the standard data dicationry uncommenting the line below
# linelist_dict$data_element_shortname


# Clean column names ---------------------------------------------

## a good first step is to assign standard column names so that subsequent code
## uses stable column names. In case the input data changes, you just need to
## fix the column mapping.

## make a copy of your orginal dataset and name it linelist_cleaned
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw

## UNCOMMENT AND RUN TWO LINES OF CODE BELOW!
##
## define clean variable names using clean_labels from the epitrix package. This
## function defines rules for variable naming; for example, it changes spaces
## and dots to "_" and sets all characters to lowercase.

# cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))
# colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames # overwrite variable names with defined clean names

## OPTIONAL: below is just an example in case you want to specifically change a
## few names you can also change specific var names using the *rename*
## function. In this example, we have the columns "gender" and "age" that we
## want to rename as "sex" and "age_years".
## The formula for this is rename(data, NEW_NAME = OLD_NAME)

# linelist_cleaned <- rename(linelist_cleaned, 
#                            gender    = sex, 
#                            age_years = age)


## OPTIONAL: if you only want to keep certain variables - 
## you can select these by name or column number view the names of your vars
## and their column number using: names(linelist_cleaned) this example keeps
## the first three columns as well as age_years and sex variables

# linelist_cleaned <- select(linelist_cleaned, c(1:3, "age_years", "sex")

## Standardising values --------------------------------------------
## 
## Data entered in through software will often code values in a compact format
## to save space. For example, Yes/No values will often be coded as 1 or 0 and
## sex coded as M or F. This line uses the MSF dictionary to recode these values
## back to a human-readable format.
linelist_cleaned <- clean_variable_spelling(linelist_cleaned,
                                            wordlists = filter(linelist_dict, !is.na(option_code)),
                                            spelling_vars = "data_element_shortname",
                                            sort_by = "option_order_in_set"
                                           )
```


```{r read_DHIS_csv_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

# If your linelist is a csv export of data from DHIS2 use this code chunk
# This assumes your data fits the standardised MSF data dictionary for this disease

## Read data ------------------------------------------------------
# CSV file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")

## get MSF data dictionary for meningitis 
# linelist_dict <- msf_dict("Meningitis")

## Fixing variable names ----------------------
## make a copy of your original dataset and name it linelist_cleaned
# linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw

## define clean variable names using clean_labels from the epitrix package
# cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))

## overwrite variable names with excel version names from data dictionary
## return which rows in the data dictionary match your column names

# match_cols <- match(cleaned_colnames, linelist_dict$data_element_name, nomatch = 0)
# cleaned_colnames[match_cols > 0] <- linelist_dict$data_element_shortname[match_cols]

## overwrite variable names with defined clean names
# colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames


## Standardising values --------------------------------------------
## 
## Data entered in through software will often code values in a compact format
## to save space. For example, Yes/No values will often be coded as 1 or 0 and
## sex coded as M or F. This line uses the MSF dictionary to recode these values
## back to a human-readable format.
## linelist_cleaned <- switch_vals(df = linelist_cleaned, disease = "Meningitis")
```



```{r read_nonDHIS_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

## IF YOUR LINELIST NOT AN EXPORT OF DATA FROM DHIS2 USE THIS CODE CHUNK ------
##
## This assumes your data does not fit the standardised MSF data dictionary for
## this disease. If you are using this section, be aware that this template may
## not work simply due to the unpredictable nature of non-standardized data
##
## Checklist to clean and update this script to match your data ---------------
## 
## - [ ] Recode your variable names to match this analysis 
## - [ ] Recode variable contents
## - [ ] Check the code later in the script and update it to fit your names/contents
## - [ ] Make sure to comment out all lines in read_DHIS_excel_data chunk
##
## You will still need to read in the standardised data dictionary
##   This is to understand which variables are being used later in the script
##   So that you can adapt those later code chunks to fit your dataset.
## The data dictionary has variable names in the data_element_shortname column. 
## Possible values for each variable are specified in the Code and Name columns.
## Where code has the shortened values and name has the full text values. 
##
## - [ ] run this to look at the data dictionary: 
# linelist_dict <- msf_dict("Meningitis")
# View(linelist_dict) 


## Read data ------------------------------------
# Excel file
# to read in a specific sheet use "which"
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")
# 
# For password protected Excel file 
# use the excel.link package 
# library(excel.link)
# linelist_raw <- xl.read.file("linelist.xlsx",
#                              xl.sheet = "Sheet1",
#                              password = askpass::askpass("please enter file password"))
# CSV file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")
# 
# Stata data file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.dat")

## Fixing variable names ----------------------

## make a copy of your orginal dataset and name it linelist_cleaned
# linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw

# define clean variable names using clean_labels from the epitrix package
# this function is preset rules for variable naming 
# for example it changes spaces and dots to "_" and characters to lowercase
# cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))

# overwrite variable names with defined clean names
# colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames

## Renaming variables to match the template -------------------------------
## OPTIONAL: below is just an example in case you want to specifically change a
## few names you can also change specific var names using the *rename*
## function. In this example, we have the columns "gender" and "age" that we
## want to rename as "sex" and "age_years".
## The formula for this is rename(data, NEW_NAME = OLD_NAME). 

# linelist_cleaned <- rename(linelist_cleaned, 
#                            gender    = sex, # TEXT
#                            age_years = age  # INTEGER_POSITIVE
# )

## You can use the function msf_dict_rename_helper() to create a template based
## on the meningitis dictionary. 
## This will copy a rename command like the one above ## to your clipboard.
# msf_dict_rename_helper("Meningitis")
## Paste the result here and add add the column names from linelist_cleaned
## to the appropriate variables. PLEASE NOTE: this is not a foolproof solution;
## you still need to be aware of what each variable means and what values it
## takes. 
## 
## If there are any variables that are in the MSF dictionary that are not in
## your data set, then you should comment them out, but be aware that some
## analyses may not run because of this. 

## OPTIONAL: if you only want to keep certain variables - 
## you can select these by name or column number view the names of your vars
## and their column number using: names(linelist_cleaned) this example keeps
## the first three columns as well as age_years and sex variables

# linelist_cleaned <- select(linelist_cleaned, c(1:3, "age_years", "sex")
```








```{r read_population_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}


## USE THIS TO READ IN POPULATION OR TO CREATE IT FROM PROPORTIONS  -----------
##
## There are two options for using population data here. 
## The first one is where you only know the total population number, and the 
## proportion breakdown for categories (e.g. by age group, sex or region). 
## The second option is to read in population from excel. 
## In both cases you will need to make sure that the respective groups for 
## population fit the groups in your linelist data set!
##
## Checklist for population data ----------------------------------------------
## 
## - [ ] Decide if you have stratified population data available as counts or only proportions
## - [ ] If you have counts available:
##          - [ ] use View on the fake data generated to make sure your format in excel matches
##          - [ ] read in and clean data appropriately in the "Read data" section
##          - [ ] make sure the groups match the appropriate variable in your linelist!
## - [ ] If have total population and proportion breakdown available: 
##          - [ ] use the gen_population function in "counts from populaiton proportions" section
##          - [ ] type in your population, groups, and respective proportions
##          - [ ] group can be any categorical variable you want
##          - [ ] make sure the groups match the appropriate variable in your linelist!
## - [ ] DELETE OR COMMENT OUT THE UNUSED SECTION


## Read data ------------------------------------

## Excel file
## to read in a specific sheet use "which"
# population_data <- rio::import("population.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")

## repeat same cleaning steps as in standardise_clean_data code chunk as appropriate
## make sure your place variable name matches!

## Counts from population proportions ------------------------------------ 
## if you only know the total population and the proportions in each age group, use this function 


# generate population data by region

```


```{r lab_data}
## OPTIONAL: this section can be used to read in separate lab data
## make sure that your unique identifiers (e.g. case_number) match
## with the linelist! 
##
## Generally, lab data is included with the meningitis line list.
## If you have additional lab data, you can use this section.
##
## - [ ] DELETE THE FAKE DATA SECTION!!

## Read data ------------------------------------

## Excel file
## to read in a specific sheet use "which"
# lab_data <- rio::import("labresults.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")

## repeat same cleaning steps as in standardise_clean_data code chunk as appropriate
## make sure your unique ID variable name matches!

## Fake data ------------------------------------ 
## THE GENERATE SECTION CAN BE DELETED IF YOU HAVE YOUR 
## OWN (REAL) LABORATORY DATA! 
## it's just to be able to demonstrate script in this template
# 
# # generate artificial lab tests results

```{r browse_data, eval = FALSE}
## Browsing data ---------------------------------
## here are a few ways to do data explorations 

## view the first ten rows of data

## view your whole dataset interactivley (in an excel style format)
## Remember that `View` needs to be written with a capital *V*
View(linelist_cleaned)

## overview of variable types and contents
str(linelist_cleaned)

## gives mean, median and max values of variables
## gives counts for categorical variables
## also gives number of NAs
summary(linelist_cleaned)

## view unique values contained in variables 
unique(linelist_cleaned$sex)

## another alternative is with the "summarytools package"
## use the dfSummary function in combination with view
## note that view is not capitalised with this package
# install.packages("summarytools")
# summarytools::view(summarytools::dfSummary(linelist_cleaned))

## USE THIS TO CREATE AND CLEAN VARIABLES IN YOUR DATA  -----------------------
##
## All your data cleaning and new variable creation should happen in this chunk. 
## This way, if you mess up all you have to do is push the small arrow at the
## top of this chunk between the cogg and the play buttons, to run all the 
## code chunks up to the current one, then continue your cleaning from where you
## started. 
## 
## YOU WILL NEED TO ADAPT THIS SECTION ACCORDING TO YOUR DATA!
## 
## currently there are examples of cleaning for: 
##    - Date variables 
##    - Numeric variables 
##    - Categorical variables from numerics (e.g. age groups) 
##    - Factor variables (for creating/manipulating categorical variables)

### Person

* [Who is affected: how many in total; male or female; young, adult or old? What are the links between affected people – work place, school, social gathering?  Is there a high rate of illness in contacts?  Is there a high rate of illness in a specific group of people (e.g. health workers)? You may want to include:  a bar chart showing case numbers or incidence by age group and sex; attack rates (AR); and numbers of deaths (in suspected and confirmed cases), mortality rates and/or case fatality ratio (CFR)]  


From the start of the outbreak up until `r reporting_week` there were a 
total of `r nrow(linelist_cleaned)` cases. There were
`r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, sex == "Female")` females and
`r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, sex == "Male")` males. 

The most affected age group was `r descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_category") %>% slice(which.max(n)) %>% pull(age_category)` years. 


#### Demographics 



Cases by age group and definition 

```{r describe_by_age_group_and_def}
# use if you have lab results in your data
# get counts and props of age groups by case definition 
# include column and row totals 
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_category", "case_def", coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>%
  rename("Age group" = age_category) %>%
  rename_redundant(prop = "%") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " cases (n)") %>%
  kable(digits = 2)
```


Cases by age group and sex 

```{r describe_by_age_group_and_sex}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_category", "sex", coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Age group" = age_category) %>%
  rename_redundant(prop = "%") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " cases (n)") %>%
  kable(digits = 2)
```

Alternatively if you would like proportions to be of the total population, use the following. 

```{r total_props_agegroup_sex}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_category", "sex", 
            coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE, proptotal = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Age group" = age_category) %>%
  rename_redundant(prop = "%") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " cases (n)") %>%
  kable(digits = 2)
```


Age pyramid 

There were `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, is.na(sex))` cases missing information on sex and 
`r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, is.na(age_category))` missing age group.

```{r age_pyramid, warning=FALSE}
# plot age pyramid 
 
plot_age_pyramid(linelist_cleaned, 
                 age_group = "age_category", 
                 split_by = "sex") + 
  labs(y = "Cases (n)", x = "Age group") + # change axis  labels (nb. x/y flip)
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",     # move legend to bottom
        legend.title = element_blank(), # remove title
        text = element_text(size = 18)  # change text size
       )
```



```{r age_pyramid_under_two, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# alternatively you can also plot age in months separately (delete eval = FALSE above)

# plot age pyramid under 2s
filter(linelist_cleaned, age_years <= 2) %>%
  plot_age_pyramid(age_group = "age_group_mon",
                   split_by = "sex") +
                  # stack_by = "case_def") +
  labs(x = "Cases (n)", y = "Age group (months)") + # change axis labels (nb. x/y flip)
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",     # move legend to bottom
        legend.title = element_blank(), # remove title
        text = element_text(size = 18)  # change text size
       )
```

Of the patients, `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, patient_facility_type == "Outpatient")` were seen as outpatients and `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, patient_facility_type == "Inpatient")` were inpatients. Among inpatients, the median number of days admitted was `r median(linelist_cleaned$obs_days)`, 
with a range between `r min(linelist_cleaned$obs_days)` and `r max(linelist_cleaned$obs_days)` days.


Cases by vaccination status

```{r describe_by_vaccination_status}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, 
            counter = "previously_vaccinated", 
            coltotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Vaccination status" = previously_vaccinated, 
         "Cases (n)" = n, 
         "%" = prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

`r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, previously_vaccinated == "Yes")` reported
previous vaccination. `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, previously_vaccinated == "No")` were unvaccinated and `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, previously_vaccinated == "Unknown")` were unsure.


Cases by symptoms. 

```{r describe_by_symptoms}
# get counts and proportions for all variables named in SYMPTOMS
multi_descriptive(linelist_cleaned, SYMPTOMS) %>% 
  # re-order columns (drop total_prop too)
  select(symptom, Yes_n, Yes_prop, No_n, No_prop, Total_n) %>%
  # rename accordingly
  rename_redundant("prop" = "%") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " (n)") %>%
  kable(digits = 2)

```

If available, you can also describe the cases by lab results 

```{r describe_by_labs}
# get counts and proportions for all variables named in LABS
multi_descriptive(linelist_cleaned, LABS, .id = "Lab test") %>% 
  # re-order columns (drop total_prop too)
  select("Lab test", Positive_n, Positive_prop, Negative_n, Negative_prop, 
         Unknown_n, Unknown_prop, Total_n) %>% 
  # rename accordingly
  rename_redundant("prop" = "%") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " (n)") %>%
  kable(digits = 2)
```


You can describe the lab results by the detailed Pastorex result.

```{r describe_detailed_pastorex}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, 
            counter = "pastorex_result", 
            coltotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Pastorex result" = pastorex_result, 
         "Cases (n)" = n, 
         "%" = prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```


#### Case fatality ratio 

Of `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, patient_facility_type == "Inpatient")` inpatients, there have been `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, grepl("Dead", exit_status), patient_facility_type == "Inpatient")` deaths, of which 
`r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, exit_status == "Dead on arrival")` 
were dead on arrival. 

Among inpatients who died, the time to death is shown below. 

```{r describe_time_to_death, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
filter(linelist_cleaned, DIED, patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>% 
  descriptive(counter = "time_to_death", coltotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Time (hours)" = time_to_death, 
         "Deaths (n)" = n, 
         "%" = prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```



The case fatality ratio among inpatients with known outcomes is below.

```{r overall_cfr, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# use arguments from above to produce overal CFR
overall_cfr <- linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>%
  case_fatality_rate_df(deaths = DIED, mergeCI = TRUE) %>%
  rename("Deaths" = deaths,
         "Cases" = population,
         "CFR (%)" = cfr,
         "95%CI" = ci)

  knitr::kable(overall_cfr, digits = 2)         # print nicely with 2 digits
```


The case fatality ratio by sex among inpatients with known outcomes is below. 

```{r cfr_by_sex, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
linelist_cleaned %>%
  filter(patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>%
  mutate(sex = forcats::fct_explicit_na(sex, "-")) %>%
  case_fatality_rate_df(deaths = DIED, group = sex, mergeCI = TRUE, add_total = TRUE) %>%
  rename("Sex" = sex, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Cases" = population, 
         "CFR (%)" = cfr, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```



CFR by age group among inpatients with known outcomes

```{r cfr_by_age_group, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
linelist_cleaned %>%
  filter(patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>%
  case_fatality_rate_df(deaths = DIED, group = age_category, mergeCI = TRUE, add_total = TRUE) %>%
  tidyr::complete(age_category, 
                  fill = list(deaths = 0, population = 0, cfr = 0, ci = 0)) %>% # Ensure all levels are represented
  rename("Age Group" = age_category, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Cases" = population, 
         "CFR (%)" = cfr, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```



```{r cfr_by_case_def, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Use if you have enough confirmed cases for comparative analysis 
#
linelist_cleaned %>%
  filter(patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>%
  case_fatality_rate_df(deaths = DIED, group = case_def, mergeCI = TRUE, add_total = TRUE) %>%
  rename("Case Definition" = case_def,
         "Deaths" = deaths,
         "Cases" = population,
         "CFR (%)" = cfr,
         "95%CI" = ci) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


#### Attack rate

The attack rate per 10,000 population is below (based on available population data available for the catchment area/region of interest). 

```{r collect_variables}
# define population 
population <- sum(population_data_age$population)
```

Below gives the attack rate per 10,000 population (N = `r format(population, big.mark = ",")`)
```{r attack_rate}
# calculate the ar
# store as AR to be able to use output for automating text below (inline functions)
ar <- attack_rate(nrow(linelist_cleaned), population, multiplier = 10000)

ar %>%
  merge_ci_df(e = 3) %>% # merge the lower and upper CI into one column
  rename("Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  select(-Population) %>% # drop the population column as it is not changing
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align = "r")
```

Here, we can see that the Attack Rate for a population of `r format(population, big.mark = ",")` was `r fmt_ci_df(ar, percent = FALSE)`.

To give attack rate by age group, with appropriate population denominators, use the following code. 

```{r attack_rate_by_agegroup, warning = FALSE}
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, age_category) %>%   # cases for each week
  left_join(population_data_age_categories, by = "age_category")    # merge population data 

# attack rate for each week
attack_rate(cases$n, cases$population, multiplier = 100000, mergeCI = TRUE) %>% 
  # add the epiweek column to table
  bind_cols(select(cases, age_category), .) %>% 
  rename("Age group" = age_category, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) # set thousands separator
```


#### Mortality attributable to meningitis

THIS WHOLE MORTALITY SECTION SHOULD BE DELETED UNLESS YOU ARE IN A CLOSED SETTING 
(e.g. refugee camp). 
The assumptions don't hold in an open/community setting.

This section gives mortality rates attributable to meningitis in
a closed population. It does not calculate all-cause mortality. It 'assumes 
that all meningitis deaths are among inpatients.

This demonstrates three ways of calculating mortality rate based on 
catchment population (twice) and based on hospital population. 

```{r collect_variables_rates}
# count number of deaths 
deaths <- sum(linelist_cleaned$DIED)

# outbreak duration in days 
obs_time <- as.numeric(obs_end - obs_start)

# patient observation time 
pat_obs_time <- linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>% 
  summarise(days = sum(obs_days)) %>%
  pull(days)
```

To produce a mortality rate (attribuatble to meningitis) per 10,000 people
use the following code chunk. 
This assumes that you are capturing every meningitis death in your population. 

```{r mortality_rate}
mortality_rate(deaths, population, multiplier = 10000, mergeCI = TRUE) %>%
  rename("Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "Mortality (per 10,000)" = `mortality per 10 000`, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

To produce a crude mortality rate attributable to meningitis per 10,000 people
per day, use the folowing code chunk. 
This assumes that you are capturing every meningitis death in your population 
and that your population remains stable over the time period of interest. 
In this situation the time period of interest is from the beginning of the 
epiweek your first case occured in, until the last day of the epiweek you are 
currently reporting on. (see this [presentation](https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/events-presentations/776.pdf) for more detail)


```{r mortality_rate_CMR}
mortality_rate(deaths, population*obs_time, multiplier = 10000, mergeCI = TRUE) %>%
  rename("Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Person-days" = population, 
         "Mortality (per 10,000/day)" = `mortality per 10 000`, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

Alternatively, if you are unsure whether your hospital deaths are
representative of the wider population, use the following code chunk. 
This uses the person days of cases in your linelist with a known outcome. 
However, this will give you an unreasonably high mortality rate, as 
those in hospital will only be the most severely affected. 

```{r mortality_rate_patients}
mortality_rate(deaths, pat_obs_time, multiplier = 10000, mergeCI = TRUE) %>%
  rename("Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "Mortality (per 10,000/day)" = `mortality per 10 000`, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```



### Time

* [When did the cases fall ill? Are numbers increasing or stable? You may want to include an Epi curve (bar chart showing number of new (suspected and confirmed) cases each day/week) ]

There were `r fmt_count(linelist_cleaned, is.na(date_of_onset))` cases missing dates of onset. 

```{r create_incidence, message = FALSE}
# This code creates case counts for each week of your outbreak, overall
# As with aweek, you can change the start of your week to e.g. "Sunday week"
inc_week_7 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, interval = "Monday week")

# this sets the theme in ggplot for epicurves
epicurve_theme <- theme(
  axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
  legend.title = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey60", linetype = 3),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey60", linetype = 3)
)

                        title = "Cases by week of onset",
                        subtitle = sprintf("Source: MSF data from %s", reporting_week)
                       ) 
```

The peak of the outbreak was in `r date2week(find_peak(inc_week_7), floor_day = TRUE)`

```{r epicurve, message = FALSE}
# plot your epicurve as a ggplot (incidence::plot is different to base::plot)
basic_curve <- plot(inc_week_7, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  epicurve_labels +
  # change visuals of dates and remove legend title
  epicurve_theme

# show your plot (stored for later use) 
basic_curve
```


You could also plot biweekly if needed. There are also the options to do this by 
month, quarter or year. 

```{r biweekly_epicurve, message = FALSE}

# This code creates case counts for two week groups of your outbreak, overall
# As with aweek, you can change the start of your week to e.g. "2 sunday weeks"
inc_week_14 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, interval = "2 Monday weeks")

# plot your epicurve
plot(inc_week_14, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_14)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  epicurve_labels +
  # change visuals of dates and remove legend title
  epicurve_theme

```




You may also want to stratify by gender. 


```{r incidence_by_gender, message = FALSE}

# get counts by gender
inc_week_7_gender <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, 
                               interval = "Monday week", 
                               groups = linelist_cleaned$sex)

# plot your epicurve
# here we remove the boxes around each case as it makes gender colours hard to see! (show_cases = FALSE)
plot(inc_week_7_gender, show_cases = FALSE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7_gender)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  epicurve_labels +
  # change visuals of dates, remove legend title and move legend to bottom
  epicurve_theme
```


You could similarly stratify by vaccination status (or any other categorical variable!)

```{r incidence_by_vax_status, message = FALSE}
inc_week_7_vax <- with(linelist_cleaned,
                       incidence(date_of_onset, 
                                 interval = "Monday week", 
                                 groups = previously_vaccinated)
                      )

plot(inc_week_7_vax, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7_vax)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  epicurve_labels +
  # change visuals of dates, remove legend title and move legend to bottom
  epicurve_theme
```

Alternatively, you could stratify by sex among a subset of only inpatients. 


```{r incidence_by_sex_facility, message = FALSE}

inc_week_7_sex_fac <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  filter(patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>%
  with(incidence(date_of_onset, interval = "Monday week", groups = sex))

plot(inc_week_7_sex_fac, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7_sex_fac)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  epicurve_labels +
  # change visuals of dates, remove legend title and move legend to bottom
  epicurve_theme
```


The below gives the attack rate per week. 

```{r attack_rate_per_week, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# counts and cumulative counts by week
cases <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  arrange(date_of_onset) %>%        # arrange by date of onset
  count(epiweek, .drop = FALSE) %>% # count all epiweeks and include zero counts
  mutate(cumulative = cumsum(n))    # add a cumulative sum

# attack rate for each week
ar <- attack_rate(cases$n, population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  bind_cols(select(cases, epiweek), .) # add the epiweek column to table

ar %>%
  merge_ci_df(e = 4) %>% # merge the lower and upper CI into one column
  rename("Epiweek" = epiweek, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align = "r")
```
 

The below gives the cumulative attack rate per week. 

```{r cumulative_attack_rate_per_week}
# cumulative attack rate by week
attack_rate(cases$cumulative, population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  bind_cols(select(cases, epiweek), .) %>% # add the epiweek column to table
  merge_ci_df(e = 4) %>% # merge the lower and upper CI into one column
  rename("Epiweek" = epiweek, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align = "r")
```

The below gives case fatality ratio among inpatients per week as a proportion.

```{r cfr_per_week, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# group by known outcome and case definition 
cfr <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  filter(patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>%
  case_fatality_rate_df(grepl("Dead", exit_status), group = epiweek)

cfr %>%
  merge_ci_df(e = 4) %>% # merge the lower and upper CI into one column
  rename("Epiweek" = epiweek, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Cases" = population, 
         "CFR (%)" = cfr, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, align = "r")
```


You could plot the AR (in the population) and CFR (among inpatients only) together as line graphs by epiweek. 

```{r ar_line_graph}
ar_plot <- ggplot(ar, aes(x = week2date(epiweek) + (7 * 0.5), group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
              color = "blue", fill = "blue", linetype = 2, alpha = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ar), color = "blue", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # scale the x axis the same as the incidence curve. Expand forces it to align. 
  incidence::scale_x_incidence(inc_week_7, n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7), expand = c(0, 7 * 1.5)) +
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "AR [95% CI]", subtitle = "Attack Rate (per 100,000)") + 
  # change visuals of dates and remove legend title
  epicurve_theme
```


```{r cfr_line_graph}
cfr_plot <- ggplot(cfr, aes(x = week2date(epiweek) + (7 * 0.5), group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
              color = "red", fill = "red", linetype = 2, alpha = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cfr), color = "red", show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # scale the x axis the same as the incidence curve. Expand forces it to align. 
  incidence::scale_x_incidence(inc_week_7, n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7), expand = c(0, 7 * 1.5)) +
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "CFR [95% CI]", 
       subtitle = "Case Fatality Ratio [95% CI] Among Inpatients") + 
  # change visuals of dates and remove legend title
  epicurve_theme 

```


You could then also add the AR and CFR by week on to an epicurve. 

```{r epicurve_ar_cfr, message = FALSE, fig.height = 10}
nofx <- theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
              axis.title.x = element_blank())
cowplot::plot_grid(
  basic_curve + nofx,
  ar_plot + nofx,
  cfr_plot,
  align = "v", # align plots vertically
  axis = "lr", # only by their left and right margins
  ncol = 1     # allow only one column
)
```


We could then also look at admissions and exits among inpatients by epiweek for operational purposes. 

```{r describe_admissions_by_epiweek, warning = FALSE}
# get counts and props of admissions by epiweek and case definition 
# include column and row totals 
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "epiweek", "patient_facility_type", coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " (n)") %>% # modify _n to (n)
  rename_redundant("prop" = "%")    %>% # rename proportions to %
  kable(digits = 2)
```

The exits are among inpatients only. 

```{r describe_exits_by_epiweek, warning = FALSE}
# get counts and props of admissions by epiweek among inpatients
# include column and row totals 
linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(patient_facility_type == "Inpatient") %>% 
descriptive("epiweek", "exit_status2", 
            coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Week" = "epiweek") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " (n)") %>% # modify _n to (n)
  rename_redundant("prop" = "%")    %>% # rename proportions to %
  kable(digits = 2)
```



### Place

*  [Across what area: one or several villages, all from same school, etc. You may want to include a map of the distribution of cases; attack rates by location]

#### Descriptive

To get a basic descriptive table of cases by region and facility, as well as by region and outcome among inpatients, see below. 


```{r describe_by_region_facility}
# get counts and props of region by facility 
# include column and row totals 

descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "patient_origin", 
            "patient_facility_type",
            coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Region" = "patient_origin") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " (n)") %>% # modify _n to (n)
  rename_redundant("prop" = "%")    %>% # rename proportions to %
  kable(digits = 2)
```




```{r describe_by_region_outcome}
# get counts and props of region by outcome among inpatients
# include column and row totals 

descriptive(filter(linelist_cleaned, 
                   patient_facility_type == "Inpatient"),
            "patient_origin", "exit_status2",
            coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Region" = "patient_origin") %>%
  augment_redundant("_n$" = " (n)") %>% # modify _n to (n)
  rename_redundant("prop" = "%")    %>% # rename proportions to %
  kable(digits = 2)
```


If you do not have spatial data available, it may also be worth calculating attack rates by region. 

```{r attack_rate_by_region}

## - [ ] consider facet wrapping by an overarching unit if have many regions (e.g. by province)


cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, patient_origin) %>%   # cases for each region
  left_join(population_data_region, by = "patient_origin")    # merge population data 
# attack rate for region
ar <- attack_rate(cases$n, cases$population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  # add the region column to table
  bind_cols(select(cases, patient_origin), .) %>% 
  rename("Region" = patient_origin, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "Lower 95%CI" = lower,
         "Upper 95%CI" = upper) 

ar %>% 
  merge_ci_df(e = 4) %>% # merge lower and upper CI in to one column 
  rename("95%CI" = ci) %>%  # rename single 95%CI column
  kable(digits = 2, align = "r", format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) # set thousands separator
```

You could then also plot this on a bar chart with confidence intervals. 

```{r bar_attack_rate_by_region}
# plot with the region on the x axis sorted by increasing ar
# ar value on the y axis 
ggplot(ar, aes(x = reorder(Region, `AR (per 100,000)`),
               y = `AR (per 100,000)`)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "black", fill = "red") + # plot as bars (identity = as is)
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = `Lower 95%CI`, ymax = `Upper 95%CI`), width = 0.2) + # add CIs
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Region", y = "AR (per 100,000)", 
       captions = paste0("Source: MSF data from ", reporting_week)) + 
  epicurve_theme
```


You could also calculate mortality rate by region (cross reference with the mortality code chunk in person section for assumptions). 

```{r mortality_rate_region}

deaths <- group_by(linelist_cleaned, patient_origin) %>%
  filter(exit_status2 == "Died") %>%
  summarise(deaths = n()) %>%                 # count deaths by region
  left_join(population_data_region, by = "patient_origin")    # merge population data 

mortality_rate(deaths$deaths, deaths$population, multiplier = 10000) %>%
  # add the region column to table
  bind_cols(select(deaths, patient_origin), .) %>% 
  merge_ci_df(e = 4) %>% # merge the lower and upper CI into one column
  rename("Region" = patient_origin, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "Mortality (per 10,000)" = `mortality per 10 000`, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```



#### Maps 



```{r read_shapefiles, message=FALSE}

# DELETE THIS LINE IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN SHAPEFILE
# generate fake shapefile
map <- gen_polygon(regions = unique(linelist_cleaned$patient_origin))

## Checklist for Shapefiles ----------------------------------------------
## 
## - [ ] Your shapefile can be a polygon or points
##          - [ ] Polygons do not need to be contiguous
## - [ ] make sure the regions named in your shapefile match the appropriate variable in your linelist!
##          - [ ] this is usually the slot ID or NAME in most shapefiles
## - [ ] Check to make sure your coordinate reference system is WGS84 (this is the standard)
##        depending on how your shapefile was made it could in a different CRS
##        this could give you trouble down the line if you want to combine plots with eg. GPS points
## - [ ] DELETE OR COMMENT OUT THE FAKE SHAPEFILE SECTION



## reading in a shapefile 
## shapefiles consist of multiple files
## so you dont need to specify the file type (reas_sf recognises it for you)
# map <- read_sf(here("mapfolder", "region"))


## check the coordinate reference system (CRS)
# st_crs(map)

## set the CRS if not present using EPSG value
## this is the most commonly used 
# map <- st_set_crs(map, value = 4326) # Sets to WGS84

```

The following will plot a map based on the attack rate table. 


```{r choropleth_maps, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

## Checklist for plotting ----------------------------------------------
## - [ ] consider making categorical groupings of your AR or counts variable
## - [ ] merge your attack rate or counts table with your shapefile 
## - [ ] Choose the appropriate section below depending on if you are plotting polygons or points
## - [ ] Choose what variable you would like to fill (for polygons) or colour (for points) with (counts or AR)
## - [ ] DELETE OR COMMENT OUT THE SECTION YOU WONT BE USING

## create a categorical variable for plotting 
max_ar    <- max(ar$`Upper 95%CI`, na.rm = TRUE) # define your highest AR

breakers <- as.integer(c(0, # include zero as a standalone group
             seq(1, max_ar, by = max_ar/4) # 1 to maximum with four divisions
             ))
## add a categorical variable using the age_categories function 
## nb in this case we arent using ages - but it functions the same way!
ar <- mutate(ar, 
             categories = age_categories(`AR (per 100,000)`, 
                                         breakers = breakers)
             )


## join your ar or case counts based on matching shapefile names with regions in your ar table
mapsub <- left_join(map, ar, by = c("name" = "Region"))


## plotting with polygons ------------------------------------------------------

## choropleth 
## you could also fill by cases using `Cases (n)` in the fill option instead of `AR (per 100,000)`
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = mapsub, aes(fill = categories), col = "grey50") + # shapefile as polygon
  coord_sf(datum = NA) + # needed to avoid gridlines being drawn
  annotation_scale() + # add a scalebar
  # color the scale to be perceptually uniform 
  # drop FALSE keeps all levels 
  # name allows you to change the legend title 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(drop = FALSE, option = "C", name = "AR (per 100,000)") + 
  geom_sf_text(data = mapsub, aes(label = name), colour = "grey50") + # label polygons
  theme_void() # remove coordinates and axes



## plotting with points --------------------------------------------------------

# ggplot() +
#   # plot shapefile as point 
#   # shape 21 allows fill variable and colour border (e.g. black ring around circle)
#   # size allows you to make it bigger 
#   geom_sf(data = mapsub, aes(fill = categories), shape = 21, size = 5, color = "black") + 
#   coord_sf(datum = NA) + # needed to avoid gridlines being drawn
#   annotation_scale() + # add a scalebar
#   scale_fill_viridis_d(drop = FALSE, option = "C") + # color the scale to be perceptually uniform
#   theme_void() # remove coordinates and axes

```


You could then also throw your bar plot by region and the choropleth map, for each week, in a for-loop. 

```{r map_for_loop_epiweek, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 12}


## Checklist for plotting in for-loop ------------------------------------------
## - [ ] decide if you would like to show counts, AR or categories of those
## - [ ] define appropriate breaks to ensure legend is uniform by week
## - [ ] replace `Cases (n)` and `AR (per 100,000)` or "categories", appropriately
## - [ ] consider facet wrapping by an overarching unit if have many regions (e.g. by province)



# change region variable to a factor so that zero counts can be included
linelist_cleaned$patient_origin <- as.factor(linelist_cleaned$patient_origin)

# case counts
