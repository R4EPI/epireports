# Introduction to this template

This is a template which can be used to create an automated outbreak situation
report for cholera. 

- It is organised by time, place and person. 
- You can type normal text in white spaces (such as here) and r-code in grey
    spaces (denoted by three backticks and r) (see [Rmarkdown
    introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) and
    [Markdown basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html))
- Introductions and contents of sections are within square brackets "[...]" and
    can be deleted as appropriate
- Examples of inline code (to automate updating numbers, e.g. line 148), can
    similarly be removed/updated
- Code itself can be deleted, but as a word of caution: make sure you aren't
    deleting bits where variables are created/manipulated, or at least update
    them appropriatley
- For a more detailed exaplanation of this template, see [Wiki](https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep/wiki)
- ADD LIST ON WHICH PACKAGES WILL BE USED FOR WHAT REASONS! AND HOW TO INSTALL
- OTHER INFO TO ADD??

```{r read_DHIS_excel_data}

# If your linelist is an excel export of data from DHIS2 use this code chunk
# This assumes your data fits the standardised MSF data dictionary for this disease
# (Otherwise use one of the code chunks below for csv DHIS data and for non DHIS data)


## Read data ------------------------------------

# Excel file
# to read in a specific sheet use "which"
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")

# For password protected Excel file 
# use the excel.link package 
# library(excel.link)
# linelist_raw <- xl.read.file("linelist.xlsx",
#                              xl.sheet = "Sheet1",
#                              password = askpass::askpass(prompt = "please enter file password"))

# get MSF data dictionary for cholera 
linelist_dict <- msf_dict("Cholera")


# THIS LINE CAN BE DELETED IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN DATA! (read in above)
# use fake dataset as an example for this template
linelist_raw <- gen_data("Cholera")

## Fixing variable names ----------------------

# a good first step is to assign standard column names so that subsequent code
# uses stable column names. 
# in case the input data changes, you just need to fix the column mapping


# make a copy of your original dataset and name it linelist_cleaned
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw

# RUN BELOW TWO LINES IF YOU ARE READING IN YOUR OWN DATA!
# define clean variable names using clean_labels from the epitrix package
# this function is preset rules for variable naming 
# for example it changes spaces and dots to "_" and characters to lowercase
# cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))

# overwrite variable names with defined clean names
# colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames

# OPTIONAL: you can also change specific var names using the *rename* function
# linelist_cleaned <- rename(linelist_cleaned, sex = gender)

# only keep variables defined data dictionary 
# you could alternatively write out all the names you want to keep e.g. c("sex", "age", ...)
linelist_cleaned <- select(linelist_raw, linelist_dict$data_element_shortname)

# switch variable contents to show what you see on data entry (rather than coded values) 
linelist_cleaned <- switch_vals(df = linelist_cleaned, disease = "Cholera")

```


```{r read_DHIS_csv_data}

# If your linelist is a csv export of data from DHIS2 use this code chunk
# This assumes your data fits the standardised MSF data dictionary for this disease

## Read data ------------------------------------
# CSV file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")

# get MSF data dictionary for cholera 
# linelist_dict <- msf_dict("Cholera")

## Fixing variable names ----------------------
# make a copy of your original dataset and name it linelist_cleaned
# linelist_cleaned <- linelist_raw

# define clean variable names using clean_labels from the epitrix package
# cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))

# overwrite variable names with defined clean names
# colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames

# overwrite variable names with excel version names from data dictionary
# return which rows in the data dictionary match your column ames
# match_cols <- match(colnames(linelist_cleaned), linelist_dict$data_element_name)
# colnames(linelist_cleaned) <- linelist_dict$data_element_shortname[match_cols]

# only keep variables defined data dictionary 
# you could alternatively write out all the names you want to keep e.g. c("sex", "age", ...)
# linelist_cleaned <- select(linelist_raw, linelist_dict$data_element_shortname)

# switch variable contents to show what you see on data entry (rather than coded values) 
# linelist_cleaned <- switch_vals(df = linelist_cleaned, disease = "Cholera")
```



```{r read_nonDHIS_data}

# If your linelist NOT an export of data from DHIS2 use this code chunk
# This assumes your data does not fit the standardised MSF data dictionary for this disease
# You will need to assign all your variable names by hand in order for this script to work
  # This will also require you to recode variable contents to match 
  # Alternatively, you could adapt the code later in the script to fit your names/contents


## Read data ------------------------------------
# Excel file
# to read in a specific sheet use "which"
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")
# 
# For password protected Excel file 
# use the excel.link package 
# library(excel.link)
# linelist_raw <- xl.read.file("linelist.xlsx",
#                             xl.sheet = "Sheet1",
#                             password = askpass::askpass("please enter file password"))
# CSV file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")
# 
# Stata data file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.dat")

## Fixing variable names ----------------------

# rename your variable names to fit the data dictionary 
# before the equals is the new name and after is the old name
# the first two have been filled as examples 
  # (where your var names are readmittedvar and pregnantoutcome)
# see the standardise_clean_data code chunk on how to recode your variables

### Person

* [Who is affected: how many in total; male or female; young, adult or old? What are the links between affected people – work place, school, social gathering?  Is there a high rate of illness in contacts?  Is there a high rate of illness in health workers? You may want to include:  a bar chart showing case numbers or incidence by age group and sex; attack rates (AR); and numbers of deaths (in suspected and confirmed cases), mortality rates and/or case fatality ratio (CFR)]  


From the start of the outbreak up until `r reporting_week` there were a 
total of `r nrow(linelist_cleaned)` cases. There were
`r linelist_cleaned %>% filter(sex == "Female") %>% count() %>% pull(n)` females affected and
`r linelist_cleaned %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>% count() %>% pull(n)` males. 

The most affected age group was `r descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group") %>% slice(which.max(n)) %>% pull(age_group)` years. 


#### Demographics 



Cases by age group and definition 

```{r describe_by_age_group_and_def}
# get counts and props of age groups by case definition 
# include column and row totals 
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group", "case_def", coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Age group (years)" = age_group, 
         "Confirmed cases (n)" = Confirmed_n, 
         "%" = Confirmed_prop, 
         "Probable cases (n)" = Probable_n, 
         "%" = Probable_prop,
         "Suspected cases (n)" = Suspected_n, 
         "%" = Suspected_prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```




Cases by age group and sex 

```{r describe_by_age_group_and_sex}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "age_group", "sex", coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Age group (years)" = age_group, 
         "Female cases (n)" = Female_n, 
         "%" = Female_prop, 
         "Male cases (n)" = Male_n, 
         "%" = Male_prop,
         "Missing (n)" = NA_n, 
         "%" = NA_prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```



Age pyramid by case definition 

There were `r sum(is.na(linelist_cleaned$sex))` cases missing information on sex, 
`r sum(is.na(linelist_cleaned$case_def))` missing case definitions and 
`r sum(is.na(linelist_cleaned$age_group))` missing age group.

```{r age_pyramid, warning=FALSE}

                 stack_by = "case_def") + 
  labs(y = "Cases (n)", x = "Age group (years)") + # change axis labels (nb. x/y flip)
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +              # move legend to bottomw
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())            # remove title
```



```{r age_pyramid_U2, warning=FALSE}

#   labs(x = "Cases (n)", y = "Age group (months)") +                   # change axis labels (nb. x/y flip)
#   theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())   # remove title and move legend
```

```{r treatment_plans, warning = FALSE}
trtpln <- descriptive(linelist_cleaned, counter = "fluids_treatment_plan") %>%
  mutate(to_print = sprintf("%d (%.1f%%)", n, prop))
trtplnA <- filter(trtpln, grepl("A$", fluids_treatment_plan)) %>% pull(to_print)
trtplnB <- filter(trtpln, grepl("B$", fluids_treatment_plan)) %>% pull(to_print)
trtplnC <- filter(trtpln, grepl("C$", fluids_treatment_plan)) %>% pull(to_print)
```

From the start of the outbreak, `r trtplnA` patients were admitted to treatment
plan A, `r trtplnB` were admitted to treatment plan B, with `r trtplnC` being
admitted to treatment plan C.

Cases by treatment plan and case definition

```{r describe_by_treatment_plan_case_def}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "fluids_treatment_plan", "case_def", 
            coltotals = TRUE, rowtotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Fluid treatment plan" = fluids_treatment_plan, 
         "Confirmed cases (n)" = Confirmed_n, 
         "%" = Confirmed_prop, 
         "Probable cases (n)" = Probable_n, 
         "%" = Probable_prop,
         "Suspected cases (n)" = Suspected_n, 
         "%" = Suspected_prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```


The median number of days admitted was `r median(linelist_cleaned$obs_days)`, 
with a range between `r min(linelist_cleaned$obs_days)` and `r max(linelist_cleaned$obs_days)` days. 
A total of `r filter(linelist_cleaned, readmission == "Yes") %>% nrow()` patients were readmitted to the CTC. 


Cases by dehyrdation severity at admission

```{r describe_by_illness_severity_admission}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "dehydration_level_at_admission", 
            coltotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Dehydration severity" = dehydration_level_at_admission, 
         "Cases (n)" = n, 
         "%" = prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

Cases by dehydration severity during stay 

```{r describe_by_illness_severity_stay}
descriptive(linelist_cleaned, "dehydration_severity_during_stay", 
            coltotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Dehydration severity" = dehydration_severity_during_stay, 
         "Cases (n)" = n, 
         "%" = prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```


#### Case fatality ratio 

To date, there have been `r sum(grepl("Dead", linelist_cleaned$exit_status))` deaths, of which 
`r linelist_cleaned %>% filter(exit_status == "Dead on arrival") %>% nrow()` 
were dead on arrival. 

Among those who died, the time to death is shown below. 

```{r describe_time_to_death}
DIED <- grepl("Dead", linelist_cleaned$exit_status)

filter(linelist_cleaned, DIED) %>% 
descriptive("time_to_death", 
            coltotals = TRUE) %>% 
  rename("Time (hours)" = time_to_death, 
         "Deaths (n)" = n, 
         "%" = prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```



The case fatality ratio among those with known outcomes is below

```{r overall_cfr}
# use arguments from above to produce overal CFR
linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>%  # remove rows with missing outcome
  summarise(deaths = sum(DIED),    # tally deaths
            population = n()) %>%  # count population
  # calculate case fatality rate
  do(case_fatality_rate(.$deaths, .$population, mergeCI = TRUE)) %>% 
  rename("Deaths" = deaths,
         "Population" = population,
         "CFR (%)" = cfr,
         "95% CI" = ci) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)         # print nicely with 2 digits
```


The case fatality ratio by sex among those with known outcomes is below. 

```{r cfr_by_sex}
# group by known outcome and sex
linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>%               # remove rows with missing outcome
  group_by(sex) %>%                              # group by sex
  summarise(deaths = sum(grepl("Dead", exit_status)),        # tally deaths
            population = n()) %>%                # tally population
  # calculate case fatality rate
  do(bind_cols(sex = .$sex, 
               case_fatality_rate(.$deaths, .$population, mergeCI = TRUE))) %>% 
  rename("Sex" = sex, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "CFR (%)" = cfr, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```



CFR by age group among those with known outcomes

```{r cfr_by_age_group}
# group by known outcome and agegroup 
linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>%               # remove rows with missing outcome
  group_by(age_group) %>%                        # group by age_group
  summarise(deaths = sum(grepl("Dead", exit_status)),    # tally deaths
            population = n()) %>%                # tally population
  # calculate case fatality rate
  do(bind_cols(age_group = .$age_group, 
               case_fatality_rate(.$deaths, .$population, mergeCI = TRUE))) %>% 
   tidyr::complete(age_group) %>%               # Ensure all levels are represented
  rename("Age group (years)" = age_group, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "CFR (%)" = cfr, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

CFR by case definition among those with known outcomes

```{r cfr_by_case_def}
# group by known outcome and case definition 
linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>%               # remove rows with missing outcome
  group_by(case_def) %>%                        # group by case_def
  summarise(deaths = sum(grepl("Dead", exit_status)),    # tally deaths
            population = n()) %>%               # tally population
  # calculate case fatality rate
  do(bind_cols(case_def = .$case_def, 
               case_fatality_rate(.$deaths, .$population, mergeCI = TRUE))) %>% 
  tidyr::complete(case_def) %>%                 # Ensure all levels are represented
  rename("Case definition" = case_def, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "CFR (%)" = cfr, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


#### Attack rate

The attack rate per 10,000 population is below - based on available population data for the whole country. 

```{r collect_variables}
# define population 
population <- sum(population_data_age$population)
```

```{r attack_rate}
# calculate the ar
# store as AR to be able to use output for automating text below
ar <- attack_rate(nrow(linelist_cleaned), population, 
                  multiplier = 10000)
rename(ar, 
       "Cases (n)" = cases,
       "Population" = population, 
       "AR (per 10,000)" = ar,
       "lower 95%CI" = lower, 
       "Upper 95%CI" = upper
       ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

Here, we can see that the Attack Rate for a population of `r format(population, big.mark = ",")` was `r fmt_ci_df(ar)`.

To give attack rate by age group, with appropriate population denominators, use the following code. 

```{r attack_rate_by_agegroup, warning = FALSE}
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, age_group) %>%   # cases for each week
  left_join(population_data_age, by = "age_group")    # merge population data 

# attack rate for each week
attack_rate(cases$n, cases$population, multiplier = 100000, mergeCI = TRUE) %>% 
  # add the epiweek column to table
  bind_cols(select(cases, age_group), .) %>% 
  rename("Age group (y)" = age_group, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) # set thousands separator
```


#### Mortality

This demonstrates three ways of calculating mortality rate based on 
catchment population (twice) and based on hospital population. 

```{r collect_variables_rates}
# count number of deaths 
deaths <- filter(linelist_cleaned, exit_status == "Dead in facility" |
                           exit_status == "Dead on arrival") %>% nrow()

# outbreak duration in days 
obs_time <- as.numeric(obs_end - obs_start)

# patient observation time 
pat_obs_time <- linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>% 
  summarise(days = sum(obs_days)) %>%
  pull(days)
```

To produce a mortality rate per 10,000 people use the following code chunk. 
This assumes that you are capturing every death in your population. 

```{r mortality_rate}
mortality_rate(deaths, population, multiplier = 10000) %>%
  rename("Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "Mortality (per 10,000)" = `mortality per 10 000`, 
         "Lower 95%CI" = lower,
         "Upper 95%CI" = upper) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

To produce a crude mortality rate per 10,000 people per day, use the folowing 
code chunk. 
This assumes that you are capturing every death in your population and that 
your population remains stable over the time period of interest. 
In this situation the time period of interest is from the beginning of the 
epiweek your first case occured in, until the last day of the epiweek you are 
currently reporting on. (see this [presentation](https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/events-presentations/776.pdf) for more detail)


```{r mortality_rate_CMR}
mortality_rate(deaths, population*obs_time, multiplier = 10000) %>%
  rename("Deaths" = deaths, 
         "person-days" = population, 
         "Mortality (per 10,000/day)" = `mortality per 10 000`, 
         "Lower 95%CI" = lower,
         "Upper 95%CI" = upper) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

Alternatively, if you are unsure whether your hospital deaths are representative
of the wider population, use the following code chunk. 
This uses the person days of cases in your linelist with a known outcome. 
However, this will give you an unreasonably high mortality rate, as 
those in hospital will only be the most severely affected. 
```{r mortality_rate_patients}
mortality_rate(deaths, pat_obs_time, multiplier = 10000) %>%
  rename("Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "Mortality (per 10,000/day)" = `mortality per 10 000`, 
         "Lower 95%CI" = lower,
         "Upper 95%CI" = upper) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```


### Time

* [When did the cases fall ill? Are numbers increasing or stable? You may want to include an Epi curve (bar chart showing number of new (suspected and confirmed) cases each day/week) ]

There were `r sum(is.na(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset))` cases missing dates of onset. 

```{r create_incidence, message = FALSE}
inc_week_7 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, interval = 7)
```

The peak of the outbreak was in `r ISOweek(find_peak(inc_week_7))`

```{r epicurve, message = FALSE}
# plot your epicurve
plot(inc_week_7, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  theme_classic() + # give classic black/white graph 
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)", 
       captions = paste0("Source: MSF data from ", reporting_week)) + 
  # change visuals of dates and remove legend title
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        legend.title = element_blank())  
```


You may also want to stratify by gender. 


```{r incidence_by_gender, message = FALSE}
inc_week_7 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, 
                        interval = 7, 
                        groups = linelist_cleaned$sex)
plot(inc_week_7, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7)) + 
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  theme_classic() + # give classic black/white graph 
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)", 
       captions = paste0("Source: MSF data from ", reporting_week)) + 
  # change visuals of dates, remove legend title and move legend to bottom
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom") 
```


You could similarly stratify by case definition (or any other categorical variable!)


```{r incidence_by_case_def, message = FALSE}
inc_week_7 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset, 
                        interval = 7, 
                        groups = linelist_cleaned$case_def)
plot(inc_week_7, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7)) + 
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  theme_classic() + # give classic black/white graph 
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)", 
       captions = paste0("Source: MSF data from ", reporting_week)) + 
  # change visuals of dates, remove legend title and move legend to bottom
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom") 
```


Alternatively, you could stratify by sex among a subset of only confirmed cases. 


```{r incidence_by_sex_confirmed, message = FALSE}
inc_week_7 <- incidence(linelist_cleaned$date_of_onset[linelist_cleaned$case_def == "Confirmed"], 
                        interval = 7, 
                        groups = linelist_cleaned$sex[linelist_cleaned$case_def == "Confirmed"])
plot(inc_week_7, show_cases = TRUE, border = "black", n_breaks = nrow(inc_week_7)) + 
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  theme_classic() + # give classic black/white graph 
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Calendar week", y = "Cases (n)", 
       captions = paste0("Source: MSF data from ", reporting_week)) + 
  # change visuals of dates, remove legend title and move legend to bottom
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), 
        legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom") 
```


The below gives the attack rate per week. 

```{r attack_rate_per_week}
# counts and cummulative counts by week
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, epiweek) %>% 
  mutate(cummulative = cumsum(n))

# attack rate for each week
attack_rate(cases$n, population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  # add the epiweek column to table
  bind_cols(select(cases, epiweek), .) %>% 
  rename("Epiweek" = epiweek, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "Lower 95%CI" = lower,
         "Upper 95%CI" = upper) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```
 

The below gives the cummulative attack rate per week. 

```{r cummulative_attack_rate_per_week}
# cummulative attack rate by week
attack_rate(cases$cummulative, population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  # add the epiweek column to table
  bind_cols(select(cases, epiweek), .) %>% 
  rename("Epiweek" = epiweek, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "Lower 95%CI" = lower,
         "Upper 95%CI" = upper) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

The below gives case fatility rate per week. 

```{r cfr_per_week}
# group by known outcome and case definition 
linelist_cleaned %>% 
  filter(!is.na(exit_status)) %>%               # remove rows with missing outcome
  group_by(epiweek) %>%                        # group by case_def
  summarise(deaths = sum(grepl("Dead", exit_status)),  # tally deaths
            population = n()) %>%               # tally population
  # calculate case fatality rate
  do(bind_cols(epiweek = .$epiweek, 
               case_fatality_rate(.$deaths, .$population, mergeCI = TRUE))) %>% 
  tidyr::complete(epiweek) %>%                 # Ensure all levels are represented
  rename("Epiweek" = epiweek, 
         "Deaths" = deaths, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "CFR (%)" = cfr, 
         "95%CI" = ci) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


### Place

*  [Across what area: one or several villages, all from same school, etc. You may want to include a map of the distribution of cases; attack rates by location]

If you do not have spatial data available, it may be worth calculating attack rates by region. 

```{r attack_rate_by_region}
cases <- count(linelist_cleaned, patient_origin_free_text) %>%   # cases for each week
  left_join(population_data_region, by = "patient_origin_free_text")    # merge population data 
# attack rate for each week
ar <- attack_rate(cases$n, cases$population, multiplier = 100000) %>% 
  # add the epiweek column to table
  bind_cols(select(cases, patient_origin_free_text), .) %>% 
  rename("Region" = patient_origin_free_text, 
         "Cases (n)" = cases, 
         "Population" = population, 
         "AR (per 100,000)" = ar, 
         "Lower 95%CI" = lower,
         "Upper 95%CI" = upper) 

kable(ar, digits = 2, format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) # set thousands separator
```

You could then also plot this on a bar chart with confidence intervals. 

```{r bar_attack_rate_by_region}
# plot with the region on the x axis sorted by increasing ar
# ar value on the y axis 
ggplot(ar, aes(x = reorder(Region, `AR (per 100,000)`),
               y = `AR (per 100,000)`)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", col = "black", fill = "red") + # plot as bars (identity = as is)
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = `Lower 95%CI`, ymax = `Upper 95%CI`), width = 0.2) + # add CIs
  theme_classic() + # give classic black/white graph 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +  # set origin for axes
  # add labels to axes and below chart
  labs(x = "Region", y = "AR (per 100,000", 
       captions = paste0("Source: MSF data from ", reporting_week))

```
