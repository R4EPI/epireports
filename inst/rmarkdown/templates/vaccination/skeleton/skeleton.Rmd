# Introduction to this template
This is a template which will guide you through the following steps:  
  - merging household and individual level data
  - calculating overall proportion of children <15 vaccinated against a specific pathogen
  - calculating proportion of children <15 vaccinated against a specific pathogen by age group, location and gender
  

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, error = TRUE, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 12)
# set default NA to - in output, define figure width/height
options(knitr.kable.NA = "-")

``` {r survey design}
# TODO - figure out weights to use and design effect

# we first need to create a survey design that reflects the study
survey_design <- svydesign(
  ids = ~ cluster, # cluster id is stored as cluster
  weights = weights, #sampling weights applied to this example
  data = vaccine_data_clean
)
```



## Characteristics of the sampled children

Children included in the survey by sex
```{r participant description by sex}

# get counts and proportions of participants by sex
descriptive(vaccine_data_clean, "sex") %>%
  # change table column names 
  # rename( new variable name = old variable name)
  rename("Sex" = sex, "Number of participants (n)" = n,"Proportion (%)" =  prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```


Children included in the survey by age group
```{r participant description by age group}

# get counts and proportions of participants by age group
descriptive(vaccine_data_clean, "age_group") %>%
  # change table column names 
  # rename( new variable name = old variable name)
  rename("Age group" = age_group, "Number of participants (n)" = n,"Proportion (%)" =  prop) %>% 
  kable(digits = 2)
```

Age pyramid

```{r age_pyramid, warning=FALSE}
# plot age pyramid 
plot_age_pyramid(vaccine_data_clean, age_group = "age_group", split_by = "sex") + 
  labs(x = "Number of included children", y = "Age group (months)") +                    # change axis labels
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())   # remove title and move legend
```


# Vaccination coverage
Accepting equal validity from self-reported and card-reported vaccination status
```{r vaccination coverage overall}

suvery_ciprob(suvery_design, "vaccination_status_simple") %>%
  kable()
```


```{r vaccination coverage by sex}

suvery_ciprob(suvery_design, "vaccine_status_simple", "sex") %>%
  kable()
```


```{r vaccination coverage by age group}

suvery_ciprob(suvery_design, "vaccine_status_simple", "age_group") %>%
  kable()
```

TO DO
- Add similar breakdown but comparing self reporting vs card reporting
