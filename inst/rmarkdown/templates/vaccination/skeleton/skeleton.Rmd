# Introduction to this template

This is a template which can be used to create a report from a vaccination 
coverage survey. 

- There are sections for reading and cleaning data, followed by 
    weighting and observation time calculations and then survey analysis. 
    Use the drop-down menu on the bottom left of this script window to jump 
    between sections. 
- You can type normal text in white spaces (such as here) and r-code in grey
    spaces (denoted by three backticks and r) (see [Rmarkdown
    introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) and
    [Markdown basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html))
- Introductions and contents of sections are within square brackets "[...]" and
    can be deleted as appropriate
- Examples of inline code (to automate updating numbers, e.g. in the "Results
    section"), can similarly be removed/updated
- Code itself can be deleted, but as a word of caution: make sure you aren't
    deleting bits where variables are created/manipulated, or at least update
    them appropriatley
- For a more detailed exaplanation of this template, see [Wiki](https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep/wiki)

This template will guide you through the following steps:  
  - merging household and individual level data
  - calculating overall proportion of children <15 vaccinated against a specific pathogen
  - calculating proportion of children <15 vaccinated against a specific pathogen by age group, location and gender


## Installing and loading required packages 

Several packages are required for different aspects of  analysis with *R*. 
You will need to install these before starting. 
We will be using the following packages. Some of these packages automatically
install other packages they need to work (called dependencies).

These packages can be quite large and may take a while to download in the
field. If you have access to a USB key with these packages, it makes sense to
copy and paste the packages into Program Files/R/R-[version]/library.
  

```{r setup, include = FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# hide all code chunks in the output, but show errors
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, error = TRUE, fig.width = 6*1.25, fig.height = 6)
# set default NA to - in output, define figure width/height
options(knitr.kable.NA = "-")

# Installing required packages for this template
required_packages <- c("knitr",       # create output docs
                       "rio",         # for importing data
                       "epitrix",     # clean/shape data
                       "dplyr",       # clean/shape data
                       "tidyr",       # clean/shape data
                       "forcats",     # clean/shape data
                       "ggplot2",     # create plots and charts
                       "sitrep",      # MSF field epi functions
                       "survey",      # for survey functions
                       "srvyr"        # dplyr wrapper for survey package
                       )

for (pkg in required_packages) {
  # install packages if not already present
  if (!pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
  
  # load packages to this current session

```{r read_data_generic, message = FALSE}

## This section gives a variety of options for reading in datasets in different formats

## Read data ------------------------------------
# CSV file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.csv")
#
# Excel file
# to read in a specific sheet use "which"
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")
#
# Stata data file
# linelist_raw <- rio::import("linelist.dat")
#
# For password protected Excel file 
# use the excel.link package 
# library(excel.link)
# linelist_raw <- excel.link::xl.read.file("linelist.xlsx",
#                                          xl.sheet = "Sheet1",
#                                          password = askpass::askpass(prompt = "please enter file
#                                                                      password"))

```





```{r read_dharma_excel_data, message = FALSE}

# If your linelist is an excel export of data from Dharma use this code chunk
# If that is not the case use the code chunk above reading in other formats

## Read data ------------------------------------------------------

# This assums that you have two levels in your survey (level 0 and level 1). 
# These correspond to, for example, household and individual. 
# We will read in and later merge these two levels in to one dataset. 
# We will assume the data is not password protected (code for reading 
# password protected excels is in the read_data_generic code chunk)

## read in household data sheet
# study_data_hh <- rio::import("mortality_survey.xlsx", 
#                               which = "Level 0 Named", na = ".")

## read in individual level data sheet
# study_data_indiv <- rio::import("mortality_survey.xlsx", 
#                               which = "Level 1 Named", na = ".")

## DELETE THIS LINE --- YOU READ IN YOUR OWN DATA ABOVE!
# generates a fake dataset for use as an example in this template
study_data_raw <- gen_data(dictionary = "Vaccination", 
                         varnames = "column_name",
                         numcases = 1000)

## Data dictionary ---------------
## The data dictionary has variable names in the "column_name" column.
## Possible values for variables are specified in the "choice_code" and "choice_name"
## columns. 
## Where code has the shortened values and name has the full text values.

# read in data dictionary (for reference purposes)
# study_data_dict <- import("vaccination_survey.xlsx",
#                       which = "Data Dictionary")

## you can look at the dictionary by uncommenting the line below
# View(study_data_dict) 

## you can view variable names in the data dicationry uncommenting the line below
# study_data_dict$column_name

## DELETE THIS LINE --- YOU READ IN YOUR OWN DATA ABOVE!
# generates a fake dataset for use as an example in this template
# this dataset already has the two levels merged
# variable names are in the column_name column
# possible values for each variable are specified in the "Code" columns.
study_data_dict <- msf_dict_survey("Vaccination")
```


```{r merge_data_levels}

## Need to merge individual data with household data
## This is done using a unique identifier for the household 
## (which repeats in the individuals dataset) 
## For a Dharma dataset this variable is "fact_0_id"

## fact_0_id, the merging variable, needs to be applied to all relevant rows in the indidivual data set
## (equivalent of dragging down with mouse in excel)
## this is achieved using the fill function from the tidyr package
# study_data_indiv <- study_data_indiv %>%
#                       fill(fact_0_id)

## join the individual and household data to form a complete data set
#study_data_raw <- left_join(study_data_hh, study_data_indiv, by = "fact_0_id")
```







```{r read_population_data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

## There are two options for using population data here. 
## The first one is where you only know the total population number, and the 
## proportion breakdown for categories (e.g. by age group, sex or region). 
## The second option is to read in population from excel. 
## In both cases you will need to make sure that the respective groups for 
## population fit the groups in your linelist data set!
##
## Checklist for population data ----------------------------------------------
## 
## - [ ] Decide if you have stratified population data available as counts or only proportions
## - [ ] If you have counts available:
##          - [ ] use View on the fake data generated to make sure your format in excel matches
##          - [ ] read in and clean data appropriately in the "Read data" section
##          - [ ] make sure the groups match the appropriate variable in your linelist!
## - [ ] If have total population and proportion breakdown available: 
##          - [ ] use the gen_population function in "counts from populaiton proportions" section
##          - [ ] type in your population, groups, and respective proportions
##          - [ ] group can be any categorical variable you want
##          - [ ] make sure the groups match the appropriate variable in your linelist!
## - [ ] DELETE OR COMMENT OUT THE UNUSED SECTION


## Read data ------------------------------------

## Excel file
## See the gen_population function section below to see how to structure your data!!
## to read in a specific sheet use "which"
# population_data <- rio::import("population.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")

## repeat same cleaning steps as in standardise_clean_data code chunk as appropriate
## make sure your place variable name matches!

## Counts from population proportions ------------------------------------ 
## if you only know the total population and the proportions in each age group, use this function 


# generate population data by age groups in years 
population_data_age <- gen_population(total_pop = 1000, # set the total population 
  groups = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5+"),    # set the groups
  proportions = c(0.11, 0.07, 0.26, 0.182, 0.38),       # set the proportions for each group
  strata = c("Male", "Female")) %>%                      # stratify by gender 
  rename(age_group = groups,                        # rename columns (syntax is NEW NAME = OLD NAME)
         sex = strata,
         population = n)
```






```{r browse_data, eval = FALSE}
## Browsing data ---------------------------------
## here are a few ways to do data explorations 

## view the first ten rows of data
head(study_data_raw, n = 10)

## view your whole dataset interactivley (in an excel style format)
## Remember that `View` needs to be written with a capital *V*
View(study_data_raw)

## overview of variable types and contents
str(study_data_raw)

## gives mean, median and max values of variables
## gives counts for categorical variables
## also gives number of NAs
summary(study_data_raw)

## view unique values contained in variables 
unique(study_data_raw$q5_sex)

## check for logical date inconsistencies 
## for example check vaccinage greater than current age and return corresponding IDs
# (fact_0_id only exists in real dharma datasets - not those from gen_data 
#  function)
study_data_raw %>% 
  filter(q56_routine_vaccine_age_mth > q55_age_mth) %>% 
  select("fact_0_id")


## another alternative is with the "summarytools package"
## use the dfSummary function in combination with view
## note that view is not capitalised with this package
# install.packages("summarytools")
# summarytools::view(summarytools::dfSummary(study_data_raw))
```






```{r data cleaning}

# Additional variable name cleaning and creation of vaccination status binary variable
vaccination_clean <- vaccination_raw %>%
                      mutate(age_in_years = as.integer(q10_age_yr),
                             age_in_months = as.integer(q55_age_mth),
                             age_group = sitrep::age_categories(age_in_years, 
                                                                breakers 
                                                                = c(0,1,2,3,4,5)),
                             )
                             

```




```{r standardise_clean_data}

## All your data cleaning and new variable creation should happen in this chunk. 
## This way, if you mess up all you have to do is push the small arrow at the
## top of this chunk between the cogg and the play buttons, to run all the 
## code chunks up to the current one, then continue your cleaning from where you
## started. 
## 
## YOU WILL NEED TO ADAPT THIS SECTION ACCORDING TO YOUR DATA!
## 
## currently there are examples of cleaning for: 
##    - Date variables 
##    - Numeric variables 
##    - Categorical variables from numerics (e.g. age groups) 
##    - Factor variables (for creating/manipulating categorical variables)
##    - Adding weights based on population 
##    - Calculating observation time with start and end causes
##    - Dropping rows and columns 


## make a copy of your orginal dataset and name it study_data_cleaned
study_data_cleaned <- study_data_raw


# Clean variable names  ---------------------------------
## define clean variable names using clean_labels from the epitrix package. This
## function defines rules for variable naming; for example, it changes spaces
## and dots to "_" and sets all characters to lowercase.

# overwrite variable names with defined clean names
cleaned_colnames <- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(study_data_cleaned))
colnames(study_data_cleaned) <- cleaned_colnames 


## Some of the names outputed from Dharma are really long and painful, you can change these as below
## in case you want to specifically change a
## few names you can also change specific var names using the *rename*
## function. 
## The formula for this is rename(data, NEW_NAME = OLD_NAME)
study_data_cleaned <- rename(study_data_cleaned,
                             sex = q5_sex,
                             vaccination_routine = q2_vaccine_9months,
                             vaccination_sia = q32_vaccine_sia,

## OPTIONAL: if you only want to keep certain variables - 
## you can select these by name or column number view the names of your vars
## and their column number using: names(linelist_cleaned) this example keeps
## the first three columns as well as age_years and sex variables

# study_data_cleaned <- select(study_data_cleaned, c(1:3, "age_years", "sex")


# Date variables ---------------------------------

# IF YOU ARE USING A DHARMA DATA DICTIONARY USE THIS OTHERWISE UNCOMMENT LINES BELOW
# make sure all date variables are formatted as dates 

# select all variables which are dates using the data dictionary
# DATEVARS <- filter(study_data_dict, type == "QuestionDate") %>% 
#   select(column_name) # select date vars

# retrieving date vars from the fake dictionary (DELETE THIS)
DATEVARS <- filter(study_data_dict, data_element_valuetype == "DATE") %>%

# if you dont have a data dictionary you could do it this way too
# study_data_cleaned <- study_data_cleaned %>%
#   mutate_at(vars(matches("date|Date")), as.Date)



# Ideally you should have defined rules in your forms to make sure dates collected are logical
# If not then uncomment the following lines to fix wrong dates (or set them to NA)
# Fixing wrong dates 
# set unrealistic dates to NA, based on having browsed dates in the previous chunk
# study_data_cleaned <- mutate(study_data_cleaned,

  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())   # remove title and move legend
```


# Vaccination coverage
Accepting equal validity from self-reported and card-reported vaccination status
```{r vaccination coverage overall}

survey_ciprob(survey_design, "vaccination_status_simple") %>%
  kable()
```


```{r vaccination coverage by sex}

survey_ciprob(survey_design, "vaccine_status_simple", "sex") %>%
  kable()
```


```{r vaccination coverage by age group}

survey_ciprob(survey_design, "vaccine_status_simple", "age_group") %>%
  kable()
```

TO DO
- Add similar breakdown but comparing self reporting vs card reporting
